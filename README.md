## Quick start development

Make sure you have `npm` and the latest version of [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) installed on your local machine.

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Check for broken links

In one terminal start the server on `localhost:1313`

```bash
npm run serve
```

Then run the check in another terminal:

```bash
go run ./scripts/linkcheck
```

It will print any issues.

## Resize images

Place original images go in the `raw/` directory.

Create a directory `static/img/X` where `X` is the max width of the new images.

```bash
npm image-min
```

This resizes all the images and places them in the new folder and deletes them from `raw/`.

The syntax to include them in a post is:

```md
![alt text here](/img/800/technology.png.webp)
```
