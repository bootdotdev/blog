## Quick start development

Make sure you have `yarn` and the latest version of [hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) installed on your local machine.

```bash
yarn install
yarn serve
```

## Check for broken links

In one terminal start the server on `localhost:1313`

```bash
yarn serve
```

Then run the check in another terminal:

```bash
make buildscripts && ./bin/linkcheck
```

It will print any issues.

## Shortcodes

Use the following scripts to manage global shortcodes.

### Build the scripts

```bash
make buildscripts
```

### Add a SHORTCODE to all posts at the end of SECTION_NUMBER

```bash
./bin/addshorts SHORTCODE SECTION_NUMBER
```

### Remove SHORTCODE from all posts

```bash
./bin/rmshorts SHORTCODE
```

### Reset current ctas

```bash
./bin/rmshorts cta1
./bin/rmshorts cta2
./bin/rmshorts cta3

./bin/addshorts cta1 2
./bin/addshorts cta2 4
./bin/addshorts cta3 8
```

## Resize images

Place original images go in the `raw/` directory.

Create a directory `static/img/X` where `X` is the max width of the new images.

```bash
yarn image-min
```

This resizes all the images and places them in the new folder. 

Delete the raw images.

## Docx to markdown

Add `.docx` file to `docx/` directory.

`./scripts/docxmd.sh path_to_docx`
