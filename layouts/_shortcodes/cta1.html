      Regards and sorry for the interruption, Lane here! I built Boot.dev to give you a place to learn back-end
      development the...hard way?
      I mean easy? Maybe the "heasy" way? I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's hard because you will have to write code... like a metric ton of code.
      It's easy because my courses have a built-in game that's pretty darn fun. Give it a try.
