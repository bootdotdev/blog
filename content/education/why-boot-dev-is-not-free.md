A few days ago I received an email regarding [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) where the sender informed me:

> I am ideologically opposed to charging people for online education.

I mean fair enough right? I certainly understand this viewpoint, and perhaps I even ideologically agree. That said, let me explain why Boot.dev isn't *completely* free - though **quite a bit of it is free**.

## The lifeblood of a good learning platform is ongoing development

My current goal with Boot.dev is to provide the most effective [path to a career in backend development](https://boot.dev). Some key points regarding how I plan to do that include:

* No "what should I learn next"? Or "tutorial hell" traps. A simple and straight-forward curriculum.
* No skipping CS fundamentals. You're going to spend some time learning algorithms, data structures, and different programming paradigms.
* You'll write real code, and a lot of it.
* The whole experience should be as fun and engaging as possible. Achievements, XP, levels, all the fun stuff.
* The content will be *extremely* up to date. We won't have you learning Python 2 in 2022, or using the `var` keyword in JavaScript.

You'll notice, I can't really accomplish these goals by, say, spending a few months of my spare time writing content, then putting it out for free while I get back to work at a full time job. The content wouldn't remain up to date, wouldn't be gamified, and I simply wouldn't have the time be able to write all the material I want to. I want this thing to be as thorough as a CS degree (but more streamlined) when its complete.

This project, if it's actually going to accomplish its goals (which I believe are aligned with the student's goals) requires that myself, and maybe even a few others are able to continuously work on this thing full-time.

Right of the gate I'm bound by the constraint that I need to be able to earn a living wage through this thing.

## So what is Boot.dev's current business model anyways?

I don't think I've gotten this right yet, but at the moment we have a simple way to fund ongoing development: our "membership".

Signing up, reading *all* the content, and even playing in the code sandbox is **free for everyone**. However, after the first few chapters of any individual course, if you want to continue to "pass off" assignments, and get your answers checked for correctness you need to [become a member](https://boot.dev/pricing). There are 3 pricing options:

* A monthly plan of `$34 / mo`
* A semiannual plan of `$156 / 6 months`
* A yearly plan of `$288 / yr`

A membership subscription sill get you access to all the features and content.

## Charging the learners isn't the only way to monetize the platform

Let's take a look at a few alternative business models. I want to optimize for a few things when choosing:

* My [financial incentives should be aligned](/education/problem-of-incentives-in-education) with the incentives of the student. When they win I win.
* The overall cost to the student should be *very* low. Like `< 1%` the price of college.

### Model #1 - Totally free, ads

Benefits:

* Students get everything for free
* I could probably make enough money to support the business

Drawbacks:

* My incentives are *not* aligned with those of my students. The students become the product. My incentives wouldn't be to provide the most effective education, but simply to keep eyeballs on the product.

### Model #2 - Totally free, donations

Benefits:

* Students get everything for free
* While my incentives are not *super* financially aligned with my students, they're *somewhat* aligned. At the very least, my altruistic incentives are aligned.

Drawbacks:

* I'm skeptical I would make enough off of donations to support a full-time team. I would almost certainly need another job (I know I would need one today at least). Maybe this could happen after we've grown significantly. Kahn Academy does a great job.

### Model #3 - Charge businesses for career placement after students graduate

I actually looked into this for a couple months, and based on my research, I don't think this will work for a platform built primarily for entry-level developers. If I was providing career education to junior or mid level developers, I'm sure I could charge a "recruiting" fee to businesses or something like that. Unfortunately, companies simply don't pay to find juniors.

### Model #4 - Charge students for career coaching

This is an interesting one I've been thinking about recently. The idea is that I could open up the entire curriculum for free, then charge "lambda school"-style pricing for optional career coaching sessions for graduates. We would meet once a week on a video call to help you find a job, then if you get a high-paying job you pay us back over the first year of employment.

I think we'll experiment with this, but I'm a little skeptical, because the incentives become too focused on "weeding out" the students who are less likely to be placed in a career, rather than just educating everyone as effectively as possible.

There could be a hybrid model where the career placements subsidize the education platform, making the learning portion cheaper while still incentivizing us to provide an amazing experience.

## So what are we going to do?

Well, for now we're going to keep monetizing the way we've been doing it - simple monthly subscriptions. For students who can't afford the price, all of our content can be read for free, and hopefully that's a decent middle-ground solution until we have the bandwidth to try other things.

My priority right now is just getting this thing to a level where I can pay my server costs, my mortgage and my family's expenses without going into the red.

## A final note on the "ideological opposition"

> I am ideologically opposed to charging people for online education.

Again, I agree in my heart - but there are a few facts that I think are important to keep in mind:

At the moment, *anything* can be learned online for free. The problem that platforms like [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) are solving isn't *access* to information. It's *organizing* that information so that it can be consumed in easy, fun, and effective ways. Again, that's why I allow people to *access* all the information on Boot.dev for free.

There is a reason that people are still paying for expensive university and [bootcamp tuition](/education/cost-of-coding-bootcamp/). It's not because they can't find the information online or in a book. People are paying for content curation, for degrees and certificates, and for the external motivation that deadlines and teachers provide. I think we can do all that for less than 1% of what people are paying currently.

Anyhow, as usual, if you have any comments or think I've erred in some way, feel free to let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wagslane).
