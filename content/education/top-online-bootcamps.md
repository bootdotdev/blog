## I looked at the cost, duration, structure, and USP for each online coding bootcamp

If you’ve been living under a rock for the last decade, let me quickly tell you about what a coding bootcamp is before I get into the top online coding bootcamps. Basically, a coding bootcamp is an expensive and mentally intense way to shoehorn skills and knowledge into your brain at top speed, allowing you to skip past degrees at record speed.

In the past, you’d need a degree to get a job in computer science. But today, some kind of proof you can do what you say you can do - a certificate, or a portfolio - is often enough to get you through to the interview round. Bootcamps serve two purposes. One, they’ll give you the skills you need to get the certificate or build your own project portfolio. Two, they often offer their own certificate or project ideas.

A quick distinction: many coding bootcamps are in person. But thanks to the pandemic (and regular convenience) some of the best coding bootcamps are now online. These are often more affordable and flexible. Some coding bootcamps are even part-time.

## What is the structure of an online coding bootcamp?

A good online coding bootcamp will be a mix of instructor-led lessons, independent study, practice assignments, and group projects, much like you’d get at a university degree. The main difference is the speed at which you do these. Many online coding bootcamps require a steep time commitment of full-time work for 13-22 weeks in some cases. (Part-time or self-directed bootcamps range from 20-60 weeks.)

Online coding bootcamps are also distinct from online learning platforms like [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/) or [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Those platforms offer a variety of courses with interactive lessons but are self-guided.

They’re also separate from websites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) that basically offer degrees or certificates through online courses from accredited universities in coding. They’re intense, expensive, time-demanding, and in certain cases, very effective at teaching you to code.

## When is it worth doing an online bootcamp?

They’re expensive and time-consuming. With so many low-cost, flexible learning options available, when is it [worth doing an online bootcamp](/jobs/is-coding-bootcamp-worth-it) in 2022?

If you’re someone who struggles with self-guided learning, or if you need a sense of accountability and partnership, an online coding bootcamp will be a good option for you.

Want to know what the top 8 online coding bootcamps are? In the following sections, I’ll include the cost, the duration, the specialty, and why each online coding bootcamp makes the cut.

## 1. AppAcademy.io Online Coding Academy: Job-focused

AppAcademy.io is a great online coding bootcamp for the truly dedicated learner. They’re a fantastic option because they’re so selective with their cohorts – they only accept 5% of applicants. This online coding bootcamp teaches you the building blocks of coding: Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Git, and SQL.

I also love their mastery-based learning model. If you don’t learn the material of a given week, you can redo that week at no cost.

Since their business model relies on your future employment, this online coding bootcamp is 100% geared toward finding you a job. If you have any questions before applying, you can attend one of their [learning sessions](https://www.eventbrite.com/o/app-academy-7652449785?_fbp=fb.1.1653055214899.2055340963&_ga=GA1.2.206812906.1653055213) to answer questions. Finally, you don’t need any coding experience before you get started - they offer prep work to get everyone up to starting speed.

## 6. Springboard Online Coding Bootcamp: For Data Science Jobs

Coding is quite a vague term nowadays, necessary in any number of jobs. Rather than looking for the best online coding bootcamp, sometimes it’s better to look for online bootcamps in specific career tracks that will teach you the coding skills you need for that career track.

One of the main focal points of Springboard’s online coding bootcamp is their mentorship. Every student gets a mentor who's a working professional, keen to support you in everything from doing technical problems all the way through to career guidance.

The data science career track also comes with a job offer guarantee. It has terms and conditions, like you have to apply to a certain number of jobs per week, but it's a guarantee anyway.

This particular program comes with prerequisites – you'll need six months of active coding experience with a general-purpose programming language like python or R. You also need to be comfortable with basic probability and descriptive statistics, including concepts like means, medians, standard deviations, and more.

The career path is the start as a junior developer shortly after finishing the course. As most people know, web development and table development are here to stay. This course will prime you to also add more technologies, languages, and frameworks to develop your career and new directions.

The only requirements they list are an open mind, conversational English, and a computer with internet access. They claim that you don't need to know any coding basics, have a mathematical mind, or have a competitive mindset.

This course trains you and functionality and interactive software. You'll also learn about design and presentation for software. The final weeks of the course are dedicated to helping you create a real-world coding project in teams, mimicking conditions that you might experience in a real tech company.

## 8. Hack Reactor Immersive Online Coding Bootcamp: For the Ambitious

Hack Reactor makes a big claim for their live online coding bootcamp: that you'll be able to get a job paying potentially up to $95,000 as a software engineer, totally able to deal with any potential problem or complex application that comes up in your future job. They go so far as to say that you will be a pro after the course.

In this course, you'll work through hundreds of hours of problems to help you succeed in title interviews and in the actual job. You'll also learn how to plan, scope, build, and manage applications. You'll get experience working with React and develop a full-stack JavaScript skill set. Interesting way, they're also one of the few online coding bootcamps to assure you that you'll [learn the computer science fundamentals](https://boot.dev) which I consider very important.

### Details

**Cost:** This online coding bootcamp is more on the expensive end – you'll pay $17,980 if you pay upfront. They also offer an income share agreement which means you don't pay anything upfront, and you can defer tuition until you're making at least $60,000 a year. At that point, you'll pay 10% of your monthly income for 53 months, or less if you hit the cap.

**Duration:** This course is 12 weeks long, not including somewhere between 90 to 120 hours on the pre-course curriculum. This is aimed to give you a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and other basics of coding. Each week runs from 9 am to 8 pm, including 3 hours off for lunch and dinner. Their part-time course is 36 weeks long instead, taking place in the evenings and on weekends.

**Structure:** The structure changes based on if you're in the junior phase or the senior phase. In the junior phase, your day starts with live coding, followed by lectures, hacking, and paired programming. After lunch, you'll start a group project. Then you have dinner, and then after dinner is another lecture. After the lecture, you're getting back to work on a sprint for 1 hour. In the senior phase, you're much more self-guided. There are fewer lectures, and you're working on individual projects more.

## How to pick the right online coding bootcamp

As with every listicle of options I write, I want to be clear that there's no right answer. Some of these coding bootcamps will be better for you than others. I can't make that decision. Only you can.

What I hope to do instead is present all of the relevant information in one easy place for you to have a look at. I recommend you continue doing research to get a vibe for the reputation of these bootcamps. Online coding bootcamps are expensive, they're time-consuming, and some of them can be a little shady. It might be that you read this list and come to the conclusion that a coding bootcamp isn't right for you at all. That's okay, it might also be worth checking out our [other piece on the top mistakes you can make when trying to get a programming job](/jobs/reasons-you-cant-get-a-programming-job/).

Before you pick an online coding boot camp, I really encourage you to check out some coding tutorials online and do some self-guided learning. This can help you get a feel for if coding is right for you all together before you drop thousands of dollars on an online coding bootcamp. I can also give you a better position to start from when you do enroll in an online coding bootcamp. Those first weeks move very quickly!

Either way, with this new information you should be able to pick the right online coding bootcamp that will get you where you want to be.
