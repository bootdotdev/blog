Sorry it took so long for me to get this one out! [Learn Advanced Algorithms](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-advanced-algorithms) was just released, and I'm excited to let you all get your hands on it, even if you're just auditing it for free! The more advanced material takes quite a bit longer to produce, I wanted to triple-check to make sure I got everything correct and that I've presented it in a way that makes it easy to understand.

The course, like its prerequisite, [Learn Data](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-data-structures) Structures](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-data-structures), is written in Python, so most of the algorithms you write will be Python classes. Aside from the Python coding exercises that you can complete in your browser, multiple-choice questions help ensure you've digested the reading material. Sometimes the more math-intensive stuff simply can't be learned easily through code, so you've got to do a bit of reading.

While it's not completely necessary to take my [Learn Data Structures](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-data-structures) and [Learn Algorithms](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-algorithms) courses first, I would recommend it, even if you've learned this stuff before. It doesn't cost any extra, and the refresher will really help. I won't rehash all the Big-O complexity stuff here, because I'm assuming you're already familiar with it. In this course, we focus on implementing some of the more advanced algorithms that you would learn in a CS undergraduate degree and learn how you can recognize when algorithms of this sort will help you in your future career.

## What's included?

There are four modules.

### Module 1 - Graph Theory

In this module, we have a brief refresher on graph data structures, and implement some basic traversal algorithms like breadth and depth-first search. We also cover different types of graphs, like complete and directed graphs, and how they can be represented in code.

### Module 2 - Advanced Searches

In this module, we really round out our experience with graphs. We learn about greedy algorithms, and how they can help us write faster code. We also implement a priority queue so that we can use it as we do a deep dive on Dijkstra's algorithm. Finally, we finished the module by writing an A\* search that can find its way quickly through a muddy map - similar to what you'd need to write as a game developer.

### Module 3 - Dynamic Programming

In this module, we shift gears, and learn about how memoization and tabulation techniques can be used to optimize various algorithms by trading memory for speed. We re-write the classic Fibonacci function using dynamic programming, as well as the super useful edit-distance algorithm. Edit distance is used in the real world to calculate the similarity in spellings between words, just like how spell-checkers work.

### Module 4 - Linear Programming

In the final module, we shift course yet again to focus more on the mathematical side of things. Linear programming is a technique used to solve linear systems of equations, specifically optimization problems. We build from scratch a Simplex solver in Python and use it to calculate the exact number of cookies and cakes a baker should produce to maximize the profit in her shop.
