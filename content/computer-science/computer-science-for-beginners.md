Learning how to get into computer science can be a daunting task. There are so many career paths down which a computer education can take you, so many programming languages to master, and so many skills to learn. I’ll give you a basic rundown of what computer science *is*, along with a plethora of resources and tools to help you carve out your own [pathway into a computer science career](/computer-science/comprehensive-guide-to-learn-computer-science-online/).

## What is computer science?

Computer science, to put it simply, is the study of the principles and use of computers. The field uses the principles of mathematics, science, and engineering to study and develop computers, hardware, software, networks, databases–even artificial intelligence. It is a highly complex and critical field, as computers and technology have been integrated into virtually (that’s a little computer pun for you there) every industry, organization, and economic center in some way.

## Computer science vs. computer engineering

Computer science deals more with the study of *software*, while computer engineering deals more with *hardware* and often even bleeds into electrical engineering. Oftentimes, someone will get their undergrad in electrical engineering and either double or minor in computer science. While there can be a lot of overlap between both fields, being specific on which courses you want to take will help quite a bit.

## What are the main basics of computer science?

Computer science includes:

* The study of [algorithms](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-algorithms) and [data structures](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-data-structures)
* Computer and network design
* Writing code through the use of programming languages
* Computer organization
* Modeling data and information processes
* Artificial intelligence
* Computational problem-solving and implementation

Sound like a lot? Well, maybe, but learning the basics of computer science is actually simpler than you may think.

## How to get started with computer science

There are lots of routes you can take to get started. Formal education is one option, as there are many different set pathways to travel, complete with prebuilt lists of courses to follow. There are many beginner computer science classes that cover the fundamentals, and as you further yourself in your chosen degree you can pepper in extracurricular courses or spice things up with an interesting minor or an ambitious double-major.

Your main choices come down to:

* Learning computer science [online](/computer-science/comprehensive-guide-to-learn-computer-science-online/)
* Learning computer science at a [university](/computer-science/compsci-certificate-vs-degree)
* Learning computer science at a [bootcamp](/education/part-time-coding-bootcamp/)

## Computer science for dummies

Let’s say formal education isn’t your style. Going the self-taught route isn’t always easy, but it allows you to work at your own pace and strengthen your problem-solving skills. We will go on a quick run-down of coding languages you can focus on (and reasons why you should) before moving into resources that can aid you on your computer science journey.

![hacker face](/img/800/pexels-photo-5952651.webp.webp)

## Let’s talk programming languages

Where to start? With over 700 computer languages out there, it sounds impossible. However, like most things, programming languages follow a power law so there aren’t *that many* popular ones. Anyways, we can start with some of the simplest languages to learn. There are some general categories we can use to separate programming languages into different groups: procedural, functional, and object-oriented languages.

### Cornerstone languages of the web

Whatever specialty you choose, as long as it includes a visual component, CSS and HTML will likely play a critical role. Almost every site you see, and every web game you play, uses some form of CSS or HTML. Javascript is another one that can be considered a cornerstone language–or a language on which the basics of a solid programming career are built.

* [CSS](/javascript/html-css-javascript/) is a rule-based coding language that describes the presentation of web pages, including layout, fonts, and colors.
* [HTML](/javascript/html-css-javascript/) or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for text files in a web browser.
* [JavaScript](/javascript/best-ways-to-learn-javascript/) is a (somewhat) object-oriented computer programming language that is commonly used to create interactive effects on both the server and client sides. It is considered to be a core technology alongside HTML and CSS

### Common programming languages

* [Python](/python/best-python-resources/) is an object-oriented, high-level language that is used to build websites and software. It is also used to automate tasks and conduct data analysis.
* [Go (or Golang)](https://go.dev/) is an open-source programming language that was developed by Google engineers to have the simplicity of Python and the abilities of C. Its code can be compiled on almost any platform.
* [Java](/python/python-vs-java/) is an object-oriented language that is renowned for its portability. It requires compilation but the language can be run anywhere and is not just restricted to web browsers.
* [Ruby](/python/ruby-vs-python/) is an open-source, object-oriented language that is used for web servers, DevOps, and web scraping.
* [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) is one of the longest-standing programming languages that is still popular today for its flexibility. It's used to write applications and Operating Systems (and makes a great base for other languages to be used on top of).
* [C#](/javascript/c-sharp-vs-javascript/) is an object-oriented language that encompasses static typing, and functional and component-oriented disciplines to create numerous applications and programs, such as mobile apps, cloud-based services, and websites.

### A sneak peek beyond the basics

Once you’ve mastered a few basic languages, you can move on to more intermediate languages. Remember, these are harder languages, many of them are meant to complement basic programming languages. So why talk about it now? While it’s good to know what to look forward to in your career, it also gives you an idea of how these languages are interwoven together and build on top of each other in order to create specialized designs and meet specific needs. These are just a few samples of intermediate programming languages that are out there:

* C++ is considered to be one of the harder languages to learn. It’s an extension of the ‘C’ language, that is used for high-performance applications.
* R is specifically designed to perform statistics work across large datasets. (Not to be confused with Ruby, which is a general purpose language).
* Swift is another general purpose, multiple paradigm language developed by Apple that is mainly used for iOS and macOS.
* PHP is general-purpose scripting language that is geared for web development.
* SQL is a domain-specific language that’s designed for managing data in database management systems.
* Kotlin is cross-platform language that interoperates with Java. It is widely used for creating mobile apps on Android systems.
* Matlab is a multiparadigm programming language that allows for matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, and uses matrix math and array orientation that makes it easy to learn for scientists and engineers; though it is not open-source, as users need to buy licenses to access it.
* TypeScript is an open-source language provided by Microsoft that builds on top of JavaScript. It aim to make the JS developer experience better.
* Scala is general purpose language that is designed to support both object-oriented and functional programming.
* Perl is an older general purpose language that is both stable and portable.
* Haskell is a general purpose, functional programming language that is designed for research and industrial applications.
* XML is a markup language much like HTML but is designed to carry data, not focus on how data looks, it's not a *really* a programming language.
* COBOL is a very old language designed for business use. It's a procedural language.
* Prolog. If you’ve hit prolog, congrats–you’ve reached the harder, and more niche languages. PROLOG is a logic-based language developed by AI and can be hard for new learners to grasp because it's not procedural.

## A collection of resources for learning CS as a beginner

Now that we’ve covered a few of the more common programming languages, it's time to move on to the next phase: actually learning how to use and apply them. For that, resources are needed. If you’re looking to do independent learning, consider reading some computer science books.

## Starting a computer science path

Once you’ve completed your schooling, or even before you’ve finished, **start look for jobs straight away**. Familiarize yourself with job requirements in order to find an entry level job–though some jobs and projects can launch you into intermediate level jobs. The [outlook for computer jobs is bright](/jobs/whats-the-job-outlook-for-computer-science-students/), and with the proper set of skills learned, (and a brushed up [resume](/computer-science/computer-science-resumes)) you should be able to find a job in no time. If you’re unsure of what jobs to look for [check out some of our other articles](/categories/jobs/) for more insight.

## Can you really learn computer science?

Computer Science is, overall, a blend of math and science, of soft skills and hard skills, all it's all tied together to keep our apps, phones and computers running. Pursuing computer science requires you to become a rapacious learner with an insatiable curiosity and a strong propensity for problem-solving. Even if you think of yourself as a computer ‘dummy’, if you invest the time and effort, computer science will reward you, whichever path you choose to pursue.

Good luck!!!
