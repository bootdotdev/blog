We are looking for a course producer and editor to help us create more programming and computer science courses on Boot.dev!

If you're a highly technical developer with a love for teaching, this could be the perfect role for you! Your main responsibility will be to work with course authors and our in-house engineering team to produce new high-quality interactive courses on the Boot.dev learning platform. Our courses are _highly_ engaging with coding challenges and quizzes along the way. They are _mostly_ written (in Markdown), however, each course also typically includes 5-10 explainer videos that our in-house animators and editors help create visuals for.

Your responsibilities will include:

- Find and recruit new course authors
- Edit and review our author's courses to ensure they meet our quality standards
- Work with course authors to get their work shipped in a timely manner
- Work with our in-house developers to build any necessary interactive features the new courses need
- Make large updates to our existing courses
- Record explainer videos for the courses (hope you like being on camera!)

You'll need to be:

- A strong generalist when it comes to all things programming and computer science
- A very fast and curious learner
- A clear communicator, both written and verbal
- Entertaining and engaging on camera
- Creative in your writing style and tone
- Organized and able to manage multiple projects at once
- Able to work independently and take ownership of your projects

**How to apply**: Send an email to `lane at boot.dev` with the subject line "Course Producer Application" and include:

- Your resume
- A brief note about why you're interested in the role
- Links to any relevant work, particularly any writing or video content you've created
