We're building the smartest way to master backend development by tackling the hardest problem with e-learning: boredom. We're a small team of developers who love to make the process of learning as fun and hands-on as it can be.

If you're curious about what its like to work with us, check out our [public handbook](/wiki/team-handbook).

## Open positions

### Director of Business Development & Sales

- **Location**: Remote (US Timezones Preferred)
- **Salary**: DOE
- **Healthcare**: Yes if in the US
- **PTO**: Unlimited
- **Equity**: Yes, in the form of 4-year vesting stock options
- **Years of experience**: 2-5+
- **Type**: 12 week contract to hire (benefits and equity post-contract)

We are looking for our first dedicated business development/sales hire to help us expand our reach beyond the direct-to-consumer market and continue exponentially growing Boot dev. You will be expected to help develop, test, implement and maintain programs selling our product to schools, boot camps, corporate training departments and similar organizations. You will also be expected to develop relationships with companies and organizations that allow us to market our services to their customers, members and employees. While you do not need to be a programmer, the ideal candidate will have some experience with coding and online learning platforms, and be familiar with the edtech and corporate training industries.

We need a highly motivated and outgoing personality who shares our drive to eliminate boredom and make e-learning fun.

**How to apply:**

Send an email to `lane at boot .dev` with:

- Your resume
- A personal note about why you're a good fit

### Junior Video Editor/Animator

- **Location**: Remote (US/Europe Timezones Preferred)
- **Salary**: DOE
- **Healthcare**: Yes if in the US
- **PTO**: Unlimited
- **Equity**: Yes, in the form of 4-year vesting stock options
- **Years of experience**: 0-2
- **Type**: 8 week contract to hire (benefits and equity post-contract)

We're looking for our 2nd full time video editor/animator to help us create really goddamn cool educational programming videos. We have two YouTube channels:

- https://www.youtube.com/@bootdotdev
- https://www.youtube.com/@backendbanterfm

The majority of the work will be on the first channel, creating the 3-5 minute explainer videos. You'll be given raw recordings of a talking head on a green screen, and be expected to turn it into the finished product. This requires getting to know the source material, and if you don't already know how to code, an interest in learning. You won't have all the concepts spelled out for you, you'll need to figure out how to accurately animate or otherwise visually show what's going on.

We don't need someone with tons of experience, we need someone with great taste and that's able to get really good really fast.

**How to apply:**

Send an email to `lane at boot .dev` with:

- Your resume
- A link to a YouTube video you really like (that's similar to our channel) with your analysis of what you like/dislike and what you would do differently
- Links to your own work
- A personal note about why you're a good fit
- If you want to go above and beyond, try your hand at redoing one of our videos on the channel - see if you can do it better!
