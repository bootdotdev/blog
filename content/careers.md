We're building the smartest way to master backend development by tackling the hardest problem with e-learning: boredom. We're a small team of developers who love to make the process of learning as fun and hands-on as it can be.

## Open positions

### Junior Video Editor/Animator

- **Location**: Remote (US/Europe Timezones Preferred)
- **Salary**: DOE
- **Healthcare**: Yes if in the US
- **PTO**: Unlimited
- **Equity**: Yes, in the form of 4-year vesting stock options
- **Years of experience**: 0-2
- **Type**: 8 week contract to hire (benefits and equity post-contract)

We're looking for our 2nd full time video editor/animator to help us create really goddamn cool educational programming videos. We have two YouTube channels:

- https://www.youtube.com/@bootdotdev
- https://www.youtube.com/@backendbanterfm

The majority of the work will be on the first channel, creating the 3-5 minute explainer videos. You'll be given raw recordings of a talking head on a green screen, and be expected to turn it into the finished product. This requires getting to know the source material, and if you don't already know how to code, an interest in learning. You won't have all the concepts spelled out for you, you'll need to figure out how to accurately animate or otherwise visually show what's going on.

We don't need someone with tons of experience, we need someone with great taste and that's able to get really good really fast.

## How to apply

Send an email to `lane at boot .dev` with:

- Your resume
- A link to a YouTube video you really like (that's similar to our channel) with your analysis of what you like/dislike and what you would do differently
- Links to your own work
- A personal note about why you're a good fit
- If you want to go above and beyond, try your hand at redoing one of our videos on the channel - see if you can do it better!

## Our tech stack

- Backend: Go, Docker, k8s, Postgres, GCP, Pub/Sub
- Frontend: Nuxt/Vue 3, TypeScript, Tailwind, Pinia, Vite, Vercel
- Blog: Hugo, Tailwind, Vercel, Git

## Who you are

We don't know you yet, but if you're going to enjoy working with us, you'll probably have some of the following traits:

- You love to teach and share your knowledge with others
- You like to hang out in Discord
- You enjoy working remotely and are able to stay motivated without a boss looking over your shoulder
- You like to build with the latest technologies and aren't afraid to learn new things
- You get stuff done when no one is looking
- You relentlessly ship projects that you're proud of
- You're a good writer and can explain complex topics in simple terms
- You love video games. Bonus points for DotA, Starcraft, World of Warcraft or Age of Empires
- You love a good fantasy story. Bonus points for Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, and The Stormlight Archive

## Other stuff to know

- We've grown roughly 5x in the last year
- We're profitable
- Boot.dev was originally a side project, but we're now a full-time team of 9.
- We do not have plans to raise more money. We want to grow responsibly and build a sustainable business that provides value to our students.
- We like to play. We play video games, magic the gathering, eat together when possible and even take trips together when we hit our goals.
- We don't have plans to quickly sell the company or go public. It could happen, but it's more likely that we'll distribute profits to the team and owners.
