We're building the smartest way to master backend development by tackling the hardest problem with e-learning: boredom. We're a small team of developers who love to make the process of learning as fun and hands-on as it can be.

If you're curious about what its like to work with us, check out our [public handbook](/wiki/team-handbook).

## Open positions

### Video Editor/Animator

- **Location**: Remote (any 'ol place)
- **Salary**: DOE
- **Healthcare**: Yes, _if_ in the US, otherwise, pay is adjusted accordingly
- **PTO**: Unlimited
- **Years of experience**: 2-5+
- **Type**: 12 week contract to hire, then full time

We are looking for our 3rd video editor/animator to join the Boot.dev team! Your job will be to _primarily_ edit and animate educational explainer videos for our YouTube channel and courses. Here are some examples:

- https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/lesson_videos/git-merge.mp4
- https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/lesson_videos/File-Servers-vs-JSON-API.mp4

You will be given:

- The raw greenscreen talking head footage
- A script with notes about high-level ideas for what visuals to add
- A link to the lesson the explainer is based on

Your job will be to:

- Edit the video
- Add animations and visuals to help explain the concepts
- Add sound effects and music

This job not only requires solid editing and animation skills, but also a basic understanding of programming and a _strong willingness to learn about code_. While this is the primary job, you'll also help edit longer form videos like course walkthroughs, short form vertical content, and video ads.

**How to apply:**

Send an email to `lane at boot .dev` with:

- Your resume
- A personal note about why you're a good fit
- Links to your own work (the more similar to what we do, the better)
- If you want to go above and beyond, try your hand at animating a small clip one of our explainer videos on our YouTube channel - see if you can do it better!
