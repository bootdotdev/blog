## Why do organizations choose a multi-cloud strategy?
Several top-level business enterprises are moving towards multi-cloud infrastructure to make use of the advantages of different cloud services simultaneously. Also, the multi-cloud infrastructure allows businesses to take full control over their applications and data which is important for their business success. 

Here are the key reasons that force business entities to switch to multi-cloud infrastructure

- Real-time Monitoring of Applications
- Ability To Scale Deployments According to Demands
- Cost Savings & Flexibility in IT Services
- Delivers Better Results Through Collaboration

Let’s take a look over the challenges involved in adapting to multi-cloud before going deeper into the benefits part. 
## Here are some biggest challenges of Going Multi-Cloud
Before going towards a multi-cloud approach, make sure you are aware of these upcoming common challenges your business may face and find a suitable solution to tackle those.  

- **Cloud Governance:** Companies need to have desired rules and constraints to avoid financial irresponsibility and construction mess by engineers/architects in multi-cloud infrastructure. It is important to create minimum viable cloud governance that defines necessary guidelines for engineers to work.  
- **Interoperability:** In multi-cloud infrastructure, there are no standards for interoperability. This allows cloud vendors to build hyper-customization causing difficulties for companies while switching to other cloud environments. To avoid that, business enterprises need to keep a certain degree of interoperability, so that they can eliminate vendor lock-in.
- **Data Portability:** Application portability can be solved technically; however porting data gives greater headaches in multi-cloud infrastructure. Several cloud providers charge “data tax” when their consumers are about to leave their cloud environment which is often expensive. So make sure how much they need to spend for data porting before hiring cloud vendors. 
## Benefits of Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Adoption
