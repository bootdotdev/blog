We create most of our courses at Boot.dev in-house, but we also love to collaborate with talented authors! If you're interested in creating a course for Boot.dev, here's some preliminary info about how we work:

1. **Course Topic**: We organize courses into larger learning paths, and our goal is always to improve the learning paths, not to simply ship "random" new courses.
   - We have an open roadmap on [GitHub here](https://github.com/bootdotdev/curriculum) where we list the learning paths that are underdevelopment.
   - Any course in a learning path that _doesn't yet have a link_ is open for authorship!
   - If you feel passionate about a topic that isn't listed, or think the structure of the learning path itself could be improved, feel free to still reach out to us with your ideas.
2. **Course Style**: Boot.dev courses are text-first, and highly interactive. While video is a _part_ of our courses, its not the primary medium. Be sure to check [other Boot.dev courses](https://www.boot.dev/courses) to get a feel for our style and structure.
3. **Compensation**: We pay authors on a contract basis, and purchase the course material outright as it's published. We also offer commissions on sales made via the author's unique referral code.
   - We do this so that we can make updates to the course as needed without needing to nag authors to keep things up to date
   - We also want to make sure that authors are compensated for their time, even on courses that might not have super broad appeal, but are nonetheless important to the learning path.
4. **Collaboration**: Authors spearhead their course, but we (Boot.dev) do provide a _lot_ of support along the way. We have in-house editors, animators, and developers that will help to copyedit, animate, and test the course material before it goes live.
5. **Who can write a course?**: We want to work with folks that are expert on the topic they want to write about. That doesn't mean you need to have a huge social following, but some existing credibility with the subject matter is important.

If you're interested in creating a course, send an email to `lane at boot dot dev` with the following information:

- A bit about yourself and your background
- The course you'd like to create
- Any questions you have about the process

We'll get back to you as soon as we can!
