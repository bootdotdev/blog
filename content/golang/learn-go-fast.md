Want to learn Go fast? The good news is that Go is one of the simplest programming languages out there. It was designed to have a compact feature set, which means you can learn it much faster than most other languages.

## What is Golang?

The Go programming language, or Golang for short, is an open-source programming language that helps developers create simple, reliable and efficient software. Go was developed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It was designed to be fast, easy and safe to use. Go is quickly becoming one of the most popular programming languages and is one of the [best-paid languages](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-what-languages-are-associated-with-the-highest-salaries-worldwide-united-states) for developers.

## Best Courses

### [1\. Go Mastery - Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/)

![](/img/social-150x150.jpg)

We obviously have to give ourselves credit! We have recently released our new [Go Mastery course](https://boot.dev/go-mastery-course/). This course can be taken entirely in the browser and covers all the basic syntax and concepts of Go. If you have some development experience and want to start your Go career, this is the course for you.

### [2\. Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/)

Similar to Go Mastery, this course is a great way to learn the basics in the browser. This course is great and has been around for a while with a lot of support from the community. You won't get automated feedback for correct answers, but it's still a fantastic resource.

### [3\. A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)

The tour of go is supported officially by the Go language, and as such has some great high-quality information. Similar to Go By Example, the Tour of Go isn't a course with a certificate or quizzes but is more like beginner-friendly documentation and tutorials.

The tour uses the Go Playground for its computation backend (as mentioned below). The tour is great if you are unsure of whether or not you want to commit to a full course and just want to play around with the language.

### [4\. Golang University 101](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEcwzBXTPUE9V1o8mZdC9tNnRZaTgI-1P)

Here John Arundel provides a pick of Go tutorials, conference talks, and other videos that will help you learn the basics of the Go programming language.[](https://www.youtube.com/c/BitfieldConsulting)

## Best Communities

### [1\. The Go Forum](https://forum.golangbridge.org/)

The Go forum is a fairly tight-knit online community with a very go-centric community. It's a great place to start and interact with other "Gophers". I would highly recommend joining this forum as well as the other communities listed below.

### [2\. Reddit - /r/golang](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang)

If you know what Reddit is, this is the place for all Go discussion. If you don't know what Reddit is, I'm sorry.

### [3\. Gophers Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/)

If you are into real-time discussion then the Gophers slack channel is the place to be. There are plenty of awesome channels for all kinds of Go devs. Some of my favorites include:

- #newbies
- #jobs
- #showandtell
- #performance

### [4\. #golang on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23golang)

### [5\. Good Gophers list on Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1320149354120769536)

## Best Blogs

### [1\. Boot.dev Go Category](https://boot.dev/category/golang/)

We regularly publish Go-related content and you can follow it by sorting for "golang" on boot.dev. you can also grab the RSS feed [here](/category/languages/golang/feed/).

### [2\. The Go Blog](https://blog.golang.org/)

This is the official Golang blog maintained by Go team. Can't recommend it enough.

### [3\. Dave Cheney's Blog](https://dave.cheney.net/)

Dave Cheney is a personal favorite of mine. He was one of the first Gophers and has been a prolific writer and fantastic community member.
