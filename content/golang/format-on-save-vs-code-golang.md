Go has hard opinions about how you should style and format your code. Setting up your VS Code environment to enforce the standard linting and formatting rules can save you a _ton_ of time.

I don't like to think about code styling. I like to type a bunch of code with incorrect spacing and press `(ctrl+s)` or `(cmd+s)` to save my code and auto-format it.

## What you'll need

- Make sure you have the latest version of Go installed on your machine (as of the time of writing, 1.20)
- Install the [Official Golang VS Code Plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go)

Next, open your [settings.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-file-locations) file in VS Code. These settings can be specific to a single workspace or to your user account, whichever you prefer.

I use the following settings:

```json
{
  // format all files on save if a formatter is available
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  // I use "goimports" instead of "gofmt"
  // because it does the same thing but also formats imports
  "go.formatTool": "goimports",
  // go-specific settings
  "[go]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.organizeImports": true
    }
  },
  "[go.mod]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.organizeImports": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Why `goimports` and not `gofmt`?

Simply put, [goimports](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports) does everything `gofmt` does but additionally formats import statements. I like that.

## Bonus: Auto-Update, Staticcheck and Vetting

I also have these additional settings to add even more functionality to my VS Code environment. If you find them useful, feel free to use them.

```json
{
  "go.toolsManagement.autoUpdate": true,
  "go.vetOnSave": "package"
}
```

The [staticcheck](https://staticcheck.io/) tools should automatically work within VS Code if you're using the language server and the Go extension and have it [installed](https://staticcheck.io/docs/getting-started/).

## Not Working?

If it still isn't working, you likely need to reload your VS Code window and/or install the missing tools that VS Code is prompting you to install via popups in the bottom-right of the editor.

I will do my best to keep this guide up to date. Let me know if it isn't working for you in the [boot.dev Discord](https://www.boot.dev/community).
