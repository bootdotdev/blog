We just launched _[Interview Prep - Golang](https://qvault.io/interview-prep-golang-course/)_, a quick course for those looking to brush up on some Go quirks before walking into an interview. The course is a hands-on tutorial where you complete algorithms and data structures exercises, as well as answer common multiple-choice questions about the Go language.

This interview preparation review stands out because it gives a solid recap (over 30 exercises) of the language, and it's _free_ on signup!

## What's Included?

The course has two modules and covers many topics, some of which are:

- Interfaces and structs
- Error handling and testing
- Syntactic sugar
- Workspace and toolchain features
- Stacks and queues
- Channels
- Mutexes and concurrency
- Binary trees

Go is soaring in popularity among DevOps, backend, and security engineers. If you aren't familiar with Go yet, take a look at our [Go Mastery](https://qvault.io/go-mastery/) course! All code is written and scored in the browser, so no need to worry about spinning up a local development environment and copying/pasting answers.
