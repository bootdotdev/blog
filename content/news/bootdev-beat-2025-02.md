It's official: TJ's C course walkthrough was released before GTA6! This is a great month for Boot.dev, and for humanity as a whole.

Celebratorily, Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. New C Course Walkthrough

![TJ Devries C Memory Management Course](/img/800/tjhoriztonalccourse.jpg.webp)

TJ's (relatively) new [C Programming course about memory management](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-memory-management-c) now has a [full walkthrough up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJrd2QMVbGM) for free (just like all our static content). The course covers:

1. C Basics
2. Structs
3. Pointers
4. Enums
5. Unions
6. Stack and Heap
7. Advanced Pointers
8. Stack Data Structure
9. Objects
10. Refcount Garbage Collection
11. Mark and Sweep Garbage Collection

Check it out if you need additional help with the course, or if you're just interested in a refresher.

### 2. Difficulty Score Balance

Guided projects (and a few key courses) received a massive buff in the form of **more accurate difficulty scores**. We now take "time to complete" into account when calculating the difficulty score, which in turn makes those lessons award more XP, as they should.

### 3. Algos and Data Structures courses merged

![dsa course image](/img/800/dsacourseimage.jpeg.webp)

Previously, we had the "algorithms" and "data structures" courses listed as separate courses, but we've decided that it makes sense to just merge them. That's what most students expect anyway. The new [Data Structures and Algorithms course can be found here](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-python).

### 4. Miscellaneous improvements

- Improved progress visualization in the course top bar
- Added the ability to configure a persistent baseURL in the Bootdev CLI HTTP tests
- Removed the confusing green orb from the progress bar
- Replaced all YouTube embeds with native HTML5 video players

## What is yet to come

- An updated JS course (I'm almost done... so close)
- New Track Option: The second half of the backend development track in TypeScript
- Removal of the side nav in favor of a more in-depth top-nav (we're trying to free up real estate for the content)

## New YouTube Videos

We publish _all_ of our explainer videos and course walkthroughs on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bootdotdev?sub_confirmation=1) for _free_! We also just started season 2 of the [Backend Banter](https://www.backendbanter.fm) podcast:
