Our new JavaScript course is _live_! ThePrimeagen's course on building your own HTTP server from scratch is just around the corner, and the TypeScript track couldn't be closer.

Anticipatorily, Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. New JavaScript Course

![Learn JavaScript Course](/img/800/jscourse.jpeg.webp)

We've redone our JavaScript course from scratch. The old one needed so much love, that it wasn't even worth keeping. We threw it in the trash, and started anew. There are now 15 chapters, and we go pretty in-depth into some of the advanced stuff like the event loop and concurrency, so be prepared!

1. Variables
2. Comparisons
3. Functions
4. Objects
5. Classes
6. Prototypes
7. Loops
8. Arrays
9. Errors
10. Sets
11. Maps
12. Promises
13. The Event Loop
14. Runtimes
15. Modules

This is a course _for developers_, so I only recommend starting it after you've done some of our earlier Python courses.

### 2. Mobile experience that doesn't suck

Opening a Boot.dev lesson on your phone is no longer a soul-crushing experience. I mean, there's only so much we can do about the very real pain of trying to write code on a phone, but at least now you're not also doing sweet battle with our UI.

### 3. Boots is smarter

Boots is now primarily powered by Anthropic's [Claude 3.7 Sonnet model](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet), which made even bigger leaps in terms of reasoning and coding capabilities. Betters AI mentorship is better, so we hope you enjoy!

### 4. We acquired iCodeThis and are making it free

Boot.dev acquired Florin's [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/) website this month! We're still figuring out exactly what projects we want to tackle with it, but what we know for sure is that we're opening it up for free. So, if you want to practice your CSS and frontend skills, be sure to check it out!

_We haven't quite finished stripping out all the paywall logic, but it should be done any day now_.

### 5. Miscellaneous improvements

- The sidenav is gone! We've added all its functionality to the main topnav as well as the in-course menu
- The [SQL course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-sql) got a big UX update surrounding readonly test and up-migration files. The order in which the files run is also now more obvious.
- More info modals have been added to explain game mechanics
- You can now leave ratings and reviews on courses when you finish them, and the ratings are shown on the course landing pages

## What is yet to come

- ThePrimeagen's new course on the HTTP protocol, where you build and HTTP server from scratch in Go
- A brand new TS course (and FULL TS track)
- A new dashboard view that gives a better "jump back in" experience, as well as a better view into your progress

## New YouTube Videos

We publish _all_ of our explainer videos and course walkthroughs on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bootdotdev?sub_confirmation=1) for _free_! We also just started season 2 of the [Backend Banter](https://www.backendbanter.fm) podcast:
