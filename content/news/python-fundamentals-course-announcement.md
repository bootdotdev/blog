## Why Python?

Python developers are well-paid with a [$120,000 median salary](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-what-languages-are-associated-with-the-highest-salaries-worldwide-united-states). It's an extremely popular language that's loved by programmers, and the #1 language for data science, machine learning and AI.

Python reads closer to standard English than almost any other language, is simpler to learn than most, and there are huge amounts of open dev positions currently left unfilled as companies hunt for Python programmers worldwide.

## Why Boot.dev?

At boot.dev we're focused on one thing: [teaching computer science](/computer-science/comprehensive-guide-to-learn-computer-science-online/).

Following our "learning by doing" philosophy, we design our courses to be as interactive as possible, cementing learning and helping you to actively code along to challenges, lessons, and answer multiple-choice questions. 

And having been on the other side in the recruitment game, we understand how employers think, and what they're looking for.

We build our courses based on what gets you hired, and support our courses with interview prep articles and courses so you're fully prepared for your next coding job interview.
