June was hot. I got sunburned. What else happened... Oh yeah, I finished the new CI/CD course! It's slated to launch on July 10th, so watch out for that. We also are in the process of hiring a new Boot.dev team member to help us build harder better faster and stronger.

All the best, Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. New Logo

We spent some time this month working on a new logo. We wanted something that was more indicative of the fantasy theme of the site, and we're pumped with the results.

### [2. New necromancers on the leaderboard](https://boot.dev/leaderboard)

The highest rank in Boot.dev at present is "Archmage" (unlocked at level 100) and the second highest is "Necromancer" (unlocked at level 90).

We purposefully made Archmage practically impossible to reach, but with the new CI/CD course launching next month, I expect we'll have our first Archmage by the end of July. 

### [3. New videos in the Learn Algorithms course](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-algorithms)

I added a few new videos to the Learn Algorithms course, next I want to tackle some of the videos for the Learn Data Structures course! You can find the videos embedded in the course itself, or in the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4DtU2_d7hs&list=PLw1W1TeNPmy7ZReuPutxhhrcfHe5yCdsT).

## What is yet to come

* CI/CD course launches on July 10th
* New assignment types for the Learn CI/CD course: "GitHub checks" and "HTTP tests"
* Challenges and updates to the "Learn JavaScript" course

## The cream of the crop

### [(Podcast) Database Consistency & Isolation for Python Devs](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/420/database-consistency-isolation-for-python-devs)

by Talk Python

When you use a SQL database like Postgres, you have to understand the subtleties of isolation levels from "read committed" to "serializable." And distributed databases like MongoDB offer a range of consistency levels, from "eventually consistent" to "linearizable" and many options in between. I liked this one, be sure to check it out if you're interested in expanding your knowledge of databases.

### [(Article) Why I Switched From Neovim To VSCode](https://www.nexxel.dev/blog/neovim-to-vscode)

by Nexxel

As you might know I'm a VS Code guy, but have always been vim-curious. This was an interesting read because it's not often you hear someone who has put in the time to learn Vim switch back to VS Code.
