As I'm writing this on July 28th, we've had `118,984` lessons successfully completed by students on Boot.dev so far this July. This marks the first time we've had over 100k lessons completed in a month. While I'm ecstatic that we've been able to join you in so many of your learning journeys, I just want to emphasize that it's *your* journey. We're here to provide the best resources and experience that we can, but *you* deserve every ounce of credit for your hard work. **Keep it up friends.**

All the best, Lane

## Patch notes

### [1. New CI/CD Course](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-ci-cd)

The new CI/CD course using GitHub actions, Docker, PlanetScale and GCP is live! If you haven't taken a look, be sure to check it out. It's our most unique interactive course yet. You'll spend the majority of the time working in a local repository and pushing up changes to GitHub. However, our new "HTTP test" and "GitHub check" lessons types will automatically connect to your project and ensure you're doing each step correctly.

### 2. Armor for sharpshooter achievements

The sharpshooter achievement remains a student favorite, but the awkwardness of purchasing a "recovery" *after* the fact was a bit of a pain. Now, you can instead use gems to purchase *armor*, and when you fail a lesson, if you have armor, it will be consumed instead of your streak being lost.

### 3. New videos in the Learn SQL course

I've filmed 6 new explainer videos for [the SQL course](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-sql) this month, of which 4 have been released and the next 2 will be out this week. You can watch them directly on [YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYKirBUnr-8&list=PLw1W1TeNPmy4RLtkkl9PFUzAPOkgTPFkc). Of course, if you're going through the SQL course on Boot.dev then you'll encounter the videos within the course itself at the appropriate time.

## What is yet to come

* New "HTTP Test" lesson types in the web servers course
* Explainer videos for the "Learn Data Structures" course
* Challenges and reworking of the "Learn JavaScript" course
* Plans for a new "unit test" assignment type

## The cream of the crop

### [(Video) Thoughts About Unit Testing | Prime Reacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzV0mTqBcZA)

by ThePrimeagen

I wrote an article this month titled [I Mock your Mocks](https://blog.boot.dev/clean-code/writing-good-unit-tests-dont-mock-database-connections/) that Prime ended up reacting to on YouTube. If you're interested in some of my (and Prime's) controversial opinions surrounding the nuances of unit testing, mocking, and dependency injection, you might enjoy this reaction video.

### [(Podcast) Why Python is still one of the most popular coding languages](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/why-python-is-still-one-of-the-most-popular-coding-languages)

by CodeNewbie

This episode was released last year, but I still really enjoyed it, it is in no way outdated. Meredydd Luff is the guest, and he talked about why python continues to be one of the most popular coding languages and about the tool he created to help developers build full stack web apps in Python.

### [(Video) Aspiring Developers, You MUST NOT Let Up During The Job Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW7EStMLN90)

by Don The Developer

One of our very own amazing students recommend I check out this channel, and sure enough, I think Don does a great job giving career and job search advice to new developers on his channel. I particularly liked this video where he's responding to the specific questions that a fresh candidate has after a month or two of job searching.
