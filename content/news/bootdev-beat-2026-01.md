We're off to an incredible start to 2026. December of 2025 broke a new record with 3,075,904 lessons completed and 82,578 training grounds challenges completed during the month! In January, I'm writing this on the 13th, and we're already at 1,657,581 lessons and 47,795 challenges - so **it's** looking like this is going to be a monster month. Best of luck to you all in the contest of the resolute.

Sidenote: You may have noticed that it's been a couple of months since our last course release - we actually have quite a few courses in the works, they're just all going to be ready near the same time xD So expect a lot of new content dropping over the next few months. We're scaling up our production capabilities and plan to release courses more frequently. As always, quality is our _absolute top priority_, so sometimes the courses take longer to finish than we expect. We'll combat that by starting more projects in parallel with more authors, but we will never sacrifice quality for speed.

Resolutely,
Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. New Background Image

For the last couple of years we've finally had the money and time to commission human artists for the assets we need on Boot.dev - I never liked resorting to AI art, but in the early days it was that or stock art, and, well, stock was worse.

Fast forward to today, and every piece of art on the platform has **now been** drawn by a human (there are some old blog posts, but the platform itself is solid), and today was the big one - the main hero image on the landing page.

### 2. Challenge Search Improvements

In [The Training Grounds](https://www.boot.dev/training) you can search for existing challenges if you know the topic that you're looking for. We recently overhauled our more simplistic search feature for a full semantic search system powered by Cloudflare's search offering. There are more tweaks coming, but **preliminarily** this is a huge improvement to the simple keyword search that we had before.

### 3. Lesson and Spellbook Search Improvements

Next to Boots in the bottom-right corner of each lesson, you'll notice the "spellbook" and "lessons" tabs. The spellbook tab is a collection of "spellbook" pages that you unlock as you progress through the lessons. Not _all_ lessons have a spellbook page, but many do. The spellbook pages are essentially documentation, examples and cheatsheets for the concepts learned in the lessons.

There is _also_ the "lessons" tab, which is simply a search through the lessons themselves. Use this when you can't find what you're looking for in the spellbook. Lessons open in a new tab instead of within the help corner, and they're not as concise a summary, but they'll do if you don't have the spellbook page you're looking for.

### 4. Bookbot Course Moved

The [Bookbot](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-bookbot-python) guided project used to come _after_ the [Git course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-git), but it has now been moved _before_ the Git course and still _after_ the [Linux](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-linux) course. We like this change because it allows students to jump into their first **simple** coding project _before_ learning Git, which is a bit heavy of a topic before you have ever had a single local codebase to work with.

### 5. Miscellaneous Improvements

- Boots interview custom instructions improved
- New site footer - improved navigation and links
- Support for **NumPy** and **Pandas** added (this will be used in an upcoming course...)

## What Is Yet to Come

- A data visualization course in Power BI
- A new logging and telemetry course
- A cloud infrastructure (AWS) course
- A web security in TypeScript course
- A data manipulation course in Python, Pandas, and NumPy
- A Bash scripting **language** course
- More powerful LSP-like features in the in-browser editor
