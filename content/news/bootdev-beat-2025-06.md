We've capitulated into the vibe coding era? Well... not really. But it's cool to understand how AI agents like Cursor and Claude Code work under the hood.

Yours truly,
Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. New [Build an AI Agent Course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-ai-agent-python) is Live

AI assisted development is here to stay. That doesn't mean that developers won't need to know how to code, but it _does_ mean that developers should understand how their own AI powered tools work! In this new Python course, you'll build an AI agent from scratch in Python, using the Gemini API as the backing large language model. You'll learn all about tool calling and the agentic loop - it's a fun one.

Not only that, but it's taken the place of the [Static Site Generator](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-static-site-generator-python) course, which has been moved a bit further down the learning path. In fact, it took the place of the [Maze Solver](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-maze-solver-python) course, which has been moved all the way down to the deeper learning section.

### 2. Massive Speed Improvements

Our beloved team member, Dan, has spent many hours optimizing the speed and performance of the platform - specifically navigation between pages. You'll notice that once the app is loaded now, almost every subsequent page load is instant due to fairly aggresive caching and preloading of data.

### 3. Boots Improvements

Boots now automatically can see the state of your code editor without you ever needing to paste in your code. Not only is it a nice quality of life improvement, in that you don't need to click a button anymore, but it also leads to far fewer errors where you _think_ Boots knows about your code and he wasn't given context. The way it works under the hood is just that we keep track of the last time we shared your code with Boots, and we only re-send it to him if it's changed since then.

Additionally, Boot's backing models have been updated to the latest and greatest from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, and his system prompt has been updated to take into account whether or not your lesson has been completed. That means that his help _after_ the lesson is already complete is more focused on helping you deepen your understanding of the topic, rather than trying to force you to complete an already completed assignment.

### 4. Docker Course Update

Our [Learn Docker](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-docker) course has been through a massive overhaul! It now is _much_ more interactive, but also has all new animated videos that explain the concepts in a more succint and visual way. In essence, the videos now match our normal style that you've seen on most other courses.

### 5. Miscellaneous improvements

- New Boots emojis in the discord
- New difficulty and notification bell icons
- On your profile page, you can now copy a profile-embed image link to share on your GitHub profile or anywhere else

## What is yet to come

- League UI/UX updates
- A new feature... that is totally secret for now, but that has _something_ to do with better review and practice
- Walkthroughs of the JS/TS courses

## New YouTube Videos

We publish our explainer videos and course walkthroughs on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bootdotdev?sub_confirmation=1) for _free_! Here are the latest videos:

- [Without HTTPS, your data’s just out there... raw, afraid, and alone](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/drLXYsuurCw)
