This month we were heads down building a lot of background stuff for big releases that are coming up - but we still did manage to get a few new features out the door!

Yours,
Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. JavaScript Course Walkthrough

We teamed up with CoderCoder and she did a full walkthrough of our [Learn JavaScript](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-javascript) course on YouTube. You can see the [full video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOOfBC1grl0). If you've been struggling learning the quirks of JS, this should help!

### 2. Achivement Modal Rework

The old achivement modal left a lot to be desired. The big problem was that it didn't show you the full list of possible achievements, only the next one you're working toward. Now you can see them all in all their glory.

### 3. Leagues and Leaderboard Update

The [Leaderboard Page](https://www.boot.dev/leaderboard) has had a massive update since we originally shipped leagues last month - in a nutshell, it's much easier to see where you stand in your league, and the entire view is more compact and easier to read. In fact, before this update it didn't even show your entire league... so there was quite a bit to be desired in terms of UI work.

### 4. Miscellaneous improvements

- Updated demo flow and onboarding page for new users (sorry old users, doesn't matter much to you)
- The TS web scraper project now scrapes concurrently (async), similar to the Go version
- Boots can now _agentically_ (gasp) answer questions about game mechanics and pricing - we plan to give him more meta knowledge about the platform in the coming months
- We spent a good chunk of time refactoring how Boots works on the backend... which I know isn't particularly exciting _yet_, but it's teeing up some big features for the next couple of months
- Images now load with no CLS in the lessons
- Improved GitHub app syncing experience for streaks
- The new `BOOT` server tag is available on the Discord... so go rep it!

## What is yet to come

- A new RAG course
- A new feature... that is totally secret for now, but that has _something_ to do with better review and practice
- Walkthrough of the TS course
- Walktrhough of the HTTP Servers course
