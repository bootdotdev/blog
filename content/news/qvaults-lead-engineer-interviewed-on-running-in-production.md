The podcast is available [here](https://runninginproduction.com/podcast/6-qvault-is-an-open-source-tool-to-manage-passwords-and-crypto-keys).

Before I begin, I must give thanks to Nick for having me on the show! In this episode of Running in Production, I talk with Nick about how we built [boot.dev](https://boot.dev/), an open-source password manager that specializes in cryptocurrency. Boot.dev uses Electron and has a Serverless component that uses Golang. It's all hosted on AWS.

If you were ever wondering how Serverless works in the context of building a native or web application, then this episode is going to be a good listen. In addition, we talk about how different AWS services all come together to make it work. We also talk about a Serverless framework called...Serverless!
