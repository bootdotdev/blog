We hit some amazing milestones in April. We now have over 40,000 registered students and over 500,000 lessons completed on the platform! I hope your learnings are going well, and that everything we're building is helping you, even if it's in a small way.

All the best, Lane

## Patch notes

### [1. New Roles](https://boot.dev/achievements)

![roles banner](/img/800/rolesbanner.png.webp)

We've created new icons to represent the roles that you unlock by completing courses and projects. We've also added them as profile picture borders so that your role is front-and-center as the primary ornamentation on your profile page.

We've also added 3 new roles: Druid, Necromancer, and Archmage.

* **Apprentice:** Level 10
* **Pupil:** Level 20
* **Acolyte:** Level 30
* **Disciple:** Level 40
* **Scholar:** Level 50
* **Mage:** Level 60
* **Sage:** Level 70
* **Druid:** Level 80
* **Necromancer:** Level 90
* **Archmage:** Level 100

### [2. "Learn Go" Course Redressing](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-golang)

Allan and I spent the majority of our time this month making big updates to the "Learn Go" course and recording videos for it. All the videos are now recorded and edited, and we'll be releasing them on YouTube and as embedded videos in the course over the next few weeks. Keep an eye out for those to drop!

### 3. New and improved Boots

Boots, our friendly explainer of code. has undergone a significant UI update. He now explains code *much* faster, and the results are streamed to your screen as they're generated. We also make some big changes to his AI prompts so that he has *full context* for each lesson you're working on. In my experience his answers are about 4x better in terms of accuracy and relevance.

### 4. Backend Banter Podcast

I've now recorded 6 episodes of our new Boot.dev podcast: "Backend Banter". I haven't released any yet, but don't worry, they're coming and I'll be sure to link them in this newsletter when they're ready.

If you know someone I should interview about backend related topics, please let me know!

### 5. UI update

You may have noticed that we're dressing up the site with a new UI. We're not done yet, but we're making big strides. Let us know if you have any feedback on the changes.

## What is yet to come

* More UI updates, Boot.dev won't just *be* a game, it will also look and feel like one
* New challenges for the "Learn Algorithms" course
* Big update to the "Learn JavaScript" course
* A more obvious experience surrounding "karma" in the [community Discord](https://boot.dev/community)

## The cream of the crop

### [(Video) How To Get All The GitHub Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MKxFLyyUpI)

Adam is one of my favorite... coding personalities? Is that a thing? Anyhow, absolutely hilarious watch about hoarding those internet points.

### [(Article) Entering the Garden of Ferris](https://d0nut.hashnode.dev/entering-the-garden-of-ferris)

by Nathanial Lattimer (d0nut)

I don't share a ton about Rust normally, but this fantastic article must be distributed, and has a ton of useful learnings even for non-Rust devs. d0nut breaks down how he's optimized tests and performance for a large Rust project, and walks through all the nitty-gritty Docker and Kubernetes details.
