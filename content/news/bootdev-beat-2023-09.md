The best part of working on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) is seeing you all make almost unbelievable strides in not only your understanding of fundamental concepts, but what you can now *build from scratch*. It's not just that, I've been hearing a lot of stories about the *confidence* that's being gained by our alumnis after shipping so much code. That's a critical part of the journey.

As I write this, **4,379** courses have been fully completed by you all, and **905** were completed just this August.

All the best, Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. New hire: Hunter

We have, at long last, found a new full time Boot.dev team member: Hunter! You'll surely see him around in the [Discord](https://boot.dev/community), but he's a senior software engineer that loves teaching, and just so happens to share our passion for gaming. Truth be told, we only hired him so that he could carry the Boot.dev Dota 2 team to victory in our Friday afternoon games...

### [2. New Functional Programming Course](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-functional-programming)

I've been talking about this for awhile now, and it's finally done! We've released a full rewrite of our old Functional Programming course in Python. This new course goes over so much more of the fundamentals of functional programming, and it's done in a language that you already know as part of the core learning path.

The course is in private beta at the moment! It will be full released next Monday. If you'd like early access (realize there might be some rough edges) you can use the link above.

### 3. New HTTP Test lesson type

The web servers course has been fully revamped with a new lesson type: HTTP tests. Now, instead of running Go code in your browser that tests your local web server, you can see the explicit HTTP tests that will run against your local server, the expected results, and any errors that occur. All with just a click of a button.

## What is yet to come

* New "Learn Kubernetes" course
* Challenges and reworking of the "Learn JavaScript" course
* Looking into finding an animator to improve our explainer videos
* Updates to make sharpshooter less painful and more rewarding
* Plans for a new "unit test" assignment type

## The cream of the crop

### [(Podcast) WTF is an ORM](https://syntax.fm/show/633/wtf-is-an-orm)

by Syntax.fm

Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski are two of my favorite podcasters. They're both very experienced developers, and they have a great dynamic. This episode is a great introduction to ORMs if you've been hearing the term thrown around and want to know what it's all about.

### [(Video) One thing I'd Change About Go | Prime Reacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgapXdYNqWE)

by ThePrimeagen

I wrote an article this month titled [One Thing I'd Change About Go](https://blog.boot.dev/golang/one-thing-id-change-about-go/) that Prime reacted to on YouTube. If you're interested in some of my weirdo opinions about Go, and what Prime thinks about em, check it out.

### [(Article) Why Mathematical Proof Is a Social Compact](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-mathematical-proof-is-a-social-compact-20230831/)

by Jordana Cepelewicz

This one might be a bit heavy if you aren't a math nerd, but I thought it was a fun little read. The idea that even a math proof is primarily just a social idea is a bit of a thinker.
