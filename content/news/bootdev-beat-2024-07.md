**One million lessons.** Well, to be precise, you have all completed **1,122,050 lessons just in June**. That's *nuts*. I was so preoccupied with how cool it is that you all are learning so much that I'm late on this newsletter. Sorry 'bout that.

Humbly, Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. 7-Hour Python Course Walkthrough

![python course image](/img/800/trashpuppypythoncourse.jpg.webp)

[Trshpuppy](https://www.twitch.tv/trshpuppy) is an incredible developer (and past podcast guest) who recently released a complete [7-hour walkthrough of the Boot.dev Python course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M87qBgpafk). If you've been struggling with the Python course then this video is a must-watch. It's also completely free, feel free to share it with anyone who might benefit.

### 2. FP and Static Site Generator Overhaul

Our [Functional Programming Course](https://www.boot.dev/learn/learn-functional-programming) and [Static Site Generator Project](https://www.boot.dev/learn/build-static-site-generator) have had a complete overhaul. Tons of new lessons were added and updated. These were frequently cited by students as being too difficult for their spots in the curriculum, so we spent a lot of time smoothing out the difficulty curve.

### 3. Adjusted Gem Prices

We did some game balancing this month, in particular, seer stones now cost quite a bit more (10 gems). Gem drops from chests were nerfed across the board. Our goal is to continue tuning the game to only encourage the best study habits.

### 4. New Karma System

In our [Discord community](https://www.boot.dev/community) members earn Karma for being great participants. We've:

* Removed karma rewards for simply posting
* Added a significant karma reward for helping others in the forums
* Added the ability to bookmark posts for later (react with a bookmark or scroll emoji)

### 5. Miscellaneous improvements

* New art for the homepage
* Small bug fixes
* Difficulty scores show on individual lessons (updated dynamically from completion data)

## What is yet to come

* New Course: "Learn Git 2"
* New Course: "Learn Memory Management in C"
* New Course: "Linux System Administration" (this is a working title, we're still cooking...)
* New Project: "Build an Asteroids Game"
* Moving existing courses to the Boot.dev CLI
