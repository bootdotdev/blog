We plan to wrap up 2025 with some important quality of life updates! League placement badges, lesson bookmarks, and major improvements to the Training Grounds are just a few of the highlights. Thanks for learning with us, we're gearing up the platform for a _ton_ of new courses in 2026.

Enthusiastically,
Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. League Placement Badges

When you place in the top 1, 2, or 3 of your league when it ends, you'll now get a permanent badge on your profile to acknowledge your achievement. Don't worry, you'll get an in-app notification when you get one so you won't miss it!

### 2. Lesson Bookmarks

There's now a bookmark icon at the bottom of every lesson page.

You can see all your bookmarks from your bookmarks page, which is linked under the dropdown menu on your profile picture. The Training Grounds auto-generated challenges also take bookmarks into account, automatically giving you more challenges similar to bookmarked lessons.

### 3. Big Training Grounds Improvements

We've solved a lot of the challenge generation hiccups over the last few weeks, with challenges that fail to generate down by 40%! We've also started sending notifications whenever a new challenge has been automatically (and successfully) generated for you in the background. Most of the time you should be able to immediately hop into a fully personalized challenge without having to wait at all!

We've also made a massive improvement to the "Boots interview" challenge _and lesson_ types. He now responds _much_ faster and is a more sane judge of your response.

Finally, we're in the process of big updates to the "challenge search" feature in the Training Grounds. It now allows for much more granular top-level searching. We actually did a big infrastructure migration to make this happen, and now we can fine tune the performance even more and faster as we go.

### 4. Course Page Updates

The [all courses](https://www.boot.dev/courses) page has been updated with a few new features:

1. You can now filter the courses by "course" vs "guided project" using the little pills at the top of the page.
2. New and updated courses are now highlighted with "New" and "Updated" labels and the newest and most recently updated courses are now at the top of the list by default.

### 5. Miscellaneous Improvements

- Added operating system-specific headings to lesson pages - e.g., if you're on Linux, the Windows and macOS sections will be collapsed by default
- Boots now uses GPT 5.1 and Gemini 3 Pro alongside Claude Sonnet 4.5 (We _only_ use the state of the art models)
- The "solution file" viewer for locally-completed lessons now allows you to easily copy solution code with a clipboard icon
- We've added a pretty transition animation to the leaderboard's live-streamed lesson completions and the boss menu live stream
- Removed the tooltip hover delay when tooltips are already opened (feels much snappier)

## What Is Yet to Come

- A cloud infrastructure (AWS) course
- A new logging and telemetry course
- A web security in TypeScript course
- A data visualization course in Power BI
- A data manipulation course in Python, Pandas, and NumPy
- Improvements to spellbook search
