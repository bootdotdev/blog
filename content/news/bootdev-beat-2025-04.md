[The Lord of the Mire](https://www.boot.dev/lore/the-lord-of-the-mire) has been the hardest boss yet (by far), weighing it with `150,000,000` HP. The community rallied during the event, dealing a whopping `132,282,452` damage in total, but not quite enough to bring him down.

We'll get em next time,

## Patch notes

### 1. [New HTTP Protocol Course (build your own) is live](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-protocol-golang)

![Learn HTTP Protocol course image](/img/800/primehttpcourse.jpeg.webp)

[ThePrimeagen](https://www.boot.dev/teachers/the-primeagen) has done it again, with a brand new course on the HTTP protocol... from scratch! In this advanced course, you'll start with a TCP socket and build your own HTTP server on top of it - parsing all the strings yourself! The chapters include:

1. HTTP Streams
2. TCP
3. Requests
4. Request Lines
5. HTTP Headers
6. HTTP Body
7. HTTP Responses
8. Chunked Encoding
9. Binary Data

This is a course written in Golang, that isn't for the faint of heart. Best of luck, friends.

### 2. New "Got a Job" forum in the [Discord](https://www.boot.dev/community)

We update the got-a-job channel (that was causing some confusion) to be a forum, and there have already been some awesome stories of Boot.dev students landing new developer jobs there. If you've recently landed a job or got a promotion, we'd love to hear about it there!

### 3. New Boss end screen UI

Before, the boss event would end and the boss screen would kinda just... go away. Now there is a satisfying end state showing how much damage was dealt, which chests you unlocked, etc.

### 4. Miscellaneous improvements

- Improved auto sync of the `/rule` command in the discord
- New lessons report a "still calibrating" difficulty so as to not confuse students
- Streak reminders take frozen flames and embers into account properly
- New danger, warning, and info callouts in the lesson UI

## What is yet to come

- A new dashboard view that gives a better "jump back in" experience, as well as a better view into your progress
- A brand new TS course (and FULL TS track)
- A new product... that is totally secret for now
- Walkthrough of the DSA course
