I'm writing this one a bit early because I'm going out of town next week... better early than late?

Dutifully, Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. ThePrimeagen's Git 2 Course DLC

![git 2 course image](https://storage.googleapis.com/qvault-webapp-dynamic-assets/course_assets/bnHV2R1.png)

[ThePrimeagen](https://www.boot.dev/teachers/the-primeagen) has once again delivered. His first Git course had 11 chapters, this new course? Also 11 chapters. 22 chapters of glorious Git goodness. Over 140 lessons, all to teach you that you should be rebasing more and merging less. Check it out [here](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-git-2).

### 2. Go Course Revamp

Our [Learn Golang](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-golang) has had a big overhaul. We doubled down on the idea that it's a Go course for developers, not a Go course for beginners. We've added a lot of new lessons to cover some of the more esoteric and nuanced parts of the language, and we've updated the challenges to be more challenging. Additionally, the chapter on packages and modules now makes use of the Boot.dev CLI.

### 3. Course resets

This has easily been our most requested feature of the last few months, and now its here. You can reset your progress on any individual course or lesson in the platform. When you do, you won't lose any of your associated xp, gems, or items, but your progress tracker will reset. You won't gain new rewards for re-completing lessons, but you can now re-complete them and the progress tracking will work as expected.

### 4. Static Site Generator Revamp

The [Static Site Generator Project](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-static-site-generator) has had a big update, in particular, it's been made a bit easier (the feedback was that it was too hard for its spot in the curriculum) and it now gives a better up front explanation of the architecture of the project.

### 5. Miscellaneous improvements

* Achievements show the percentage of users who have completed them
* You can now mark all notifications as read
* New Boots emojis and profile picture

## What is yet to come

* New Course: "Learn Memory Management in C"
* New Course: "Linux System Administration" (this is a working title, we're still cooking...)
* New Project: "Build an Asteroids Game"
* New Track Option: The second half of the backend development track in TypeScript
