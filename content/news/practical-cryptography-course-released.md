We just launched our new _[Practical Cryptography](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-cryptography)_ course, a code-in-the-browser tutorial where students build [cryptographic](/cryptography/what-is-cryptography/) functions in the Go programming language. _Practical Cryptography_ stands out among online cryptography courses because it not only teaches crypto fundamentals, but it allows users to get hands-on experience building out the code.

## What's Included?

The course has four modules covering the following topics:

- Cryptography History and Overview
- Stream Ciphers and XOR math
- Block Ciphers and Key Schedules
- Hashes and Key Derivation Functions

We are already planning a sequel to this course which will cover public-key cryptography and some other more advanced concepts.

## Coding?

Coding projects in this course are all written in Go, a language that is soaring in popularity among DevOps, backend, and security engineers. If you aren't familiar with Go yet, take our [Go Mastery](https://boot.dev/go-mastery/) course first! All coding is done directly in the app, no need to mess around with configuring a local dev setup.
