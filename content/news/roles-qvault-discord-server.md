In our [community Discord server](https://discord.gg/EEkFwbv), we have two main groups of roles you can take on as a member, _earned_ roles and _declared_ roles. Earned roles, as you would expect, you have to earn! You can get them in various ways as we'll discuss shortly, but you can't just ask for them. Declared roles on the other hand you simply assign to yourself, and are a way of showing the community what kinds of technologies you enjoy learning about, and what your programming goals are.

## Declared roles

We have a Discord bot in our community server that you can issue commands to by typing a command in the `#bot-cli` channel. The commands take the following form.

```
/{command}
```

When you type the `/`, Discord should prompt you with a little menu to choose your command and it's available options.

To add a role, use the `addrole` command.

```
/addrole @golang
```

To remove a role, use the `rmrole` command.

```
/rmrole @python
```

Keep in mind, this will _only work for declared roles_. The following roles are all declared roles that you can update on your own.

### Roles to show off your career goals

- goal-backend-job
- goal-frontend-job
- goal-devops-job
- goal-mobile-job
- goal-data-job

### Roles to show off your favorite technologies

- javascript
- golang
- python
- rust
- java
- typescript
- c++
- sql
- html-css

### Roles to signal programming experience

- xp-new (never programmed before)
- xp-beginner (programmed but haven't had a job)
- xp-junior (in the first year of your professional career)
- xp-mid (a professional developer for more than a year)
- xp-senior (you've held a "senior" title)

### Roles to signal preferred pronouns

- he-him
- she-her
- they-them
- ask-pronouns

### Roles for notifications

- notify-workshops
- notify-morning-coffee

## Earned Roles

There are several roles you will automatically earn through your activity within Qvault's courses and projects. In order to connect your discord account to your Qvault account so that roles can be properly assigned, run the following command.

```
/sync {api_key}
```

Where `{api_key}` is the API key for your account on the [Boot.dev website](https://boot.dev/), which you can change and update in your [settings](https://boot.dev/dashboard/settings). Here are the roles that you'll unlock automatically:

- pupil - You've completed at least 25 exercises
- scholar - You've completed at least 100 exercises
- sage - You've completed 400 or more exercises

If for any reason you didn't get a role auto-assigned that you've earned, just drop a message in the `#bug-reports` channel and the team will unlock it for you.

Thanks for reading and welcome to our coding community!
