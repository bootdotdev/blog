We ran the biggest hackathon I've ever been a part of (500+ participants!) and saw some _incredible_ projects come out of it. Thanks to everyone that participated, I'm excited for the next one!

Gratefully,
Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. 2025 Hackathon Winners

If you want to see the full breakdown, check out the [Hackathon Winners post](/news/hackathon-2025), but here are some of the highlights:

2. [Codemon](https://github.com/mierdev/codemon/)

### 2. Listen to/Talk to Boots

You can now listen to Boots' messages using the "speaker" icon next to his responses in the chat. You can also record voice messages and they'll be transcribed live if you get tired of typing!

### 3. Updated Migrations Chapter in SQL Course

Our [SQL course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-sql)'s migrations chapter was a bit wonky and didn't flow well, so we've updated the whole thing to be more clear and to go through both up and down migrations in a more logical way.

### 4. New Chest Icons

Our artist just finished up a brand new set of custom chest icons! We _love_ them!
