Greetings! We're excited to announce that we've unveiled a brand-new [cryptography course](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-cryptography) on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev). We're convinced that this new experience is truly one of a kind. If you want to learn cryptography while writing real code in the [Go programming language](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-golang), you should check it out.

You can [get started for free here](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-cryptography).

## Why learn cryptography?

Ever wondered how your data is kept safe online? This course will teach you about encryption, password security, ciphers, and more. After you master the fundamentals, you'll learn how each cryptographic primitive is used in real-world applications.

If you're interested in becoming a valuable back-end engineer, an understanding of cryptography will set you apart from other candidates that will fail to answer basic security questions.

## Chapters

### 1. Symmetric Encryption

Learn the basics of cryptography: encrypting and decrypting a secret message with a key

### 2. Encoding

To be able to work with encrypted data, you need to understand how information is encoded in different formats

### 3. Brute Force

Learn about the most primitive, but most important kind of crypto attack

### 4. Caesar Cipher

Learn about the fundamentals of ciphers, starting with Julius Caesar's famous cipher

### 5. XOR

Study the importance of the XOR operation in cryptography and how it can be used to create the perfect cipher

### 6. Stream Ciphers

Stream ciphers can be used to encrypt data as it flows through a system

### 7. Block Ciphers

Block ciphers are commonly used to encrypt large amounts of data at rest, like entire hard drives

### 8. DES

DES is an older block cipher that's important to understand to appreciate modern block ciphers

### 9. AES

AES is a secure, modern block cipher that's used in many production applications

### 10. Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric encryption is used in HTTPS, digital signatures, and anywhere two parties need to securely communicate

### 11. RSA

RSA is one of the most popular asymmetric encryption algorithms

### 12. Hash Functions

Hashing has many applications in cryptography, including password security and message integrity

### 13. Digital Signatures

Digital signatures are a way to prove that a message was sent by a particular party

### 14. KDFs

Key derivation functions are how we derive keys from passwords or other keys securely

## What's inside?

You'll find text and image explanations of all the concepts, as well as video explanations of some of the more visually demanding lessons. You'll be writing real code in Go in most of the exercises, and the platform will instantly check your code and provide feedback. You'll only like the course if you enjoy an engaging hands-on experience.
