Our biggest content release **ever** just dropped: the complete backend learning path, but now in Python and TypeScript! This is a massive update that we've been working on for a year, I hope you enjoy it!

## Patch notes

### 1. New [Python/TypeScript Backend Path](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend-python-typescript) is Live

![TypeScript crushing JavaScript](/img/800/typescriptlearningpathlive.jpg.webp)

I know you're all familiar with our first learning path: [Backend Development in Python and Go](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend-python-golang). It's still our flagship learning path, and we'll keep updating it, and it remains the default for new learners. **However**, we've just finished creating a _new_ version of the path where all the Go courses (the latter back-end specific half) have been converted to TypeScript.

There's massive demand for TypeScript knowledge out there, and we want to make sure that the option to learn it is available on Boot.dev. Aside from the later courses being available _in_ TypeScript, things like:

- [Learn HTTP Clients in TypeScript](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-clients-typescript)
- [Learn HTTP Servers in TypeScript](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-servers-typescript)
- [Learn File Servers and CDNs in TypeScript](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-file-servers-s3-cloudfront-typescript)
- etc

There are also two brand new language specific courses:

- [Learn JavaScript](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-javascript)
- [Learn TypeScript](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-typescript)

These are frankly, pretty _massive_ courses, each weighing in at 15 chapters and over 100 lessons. They're designed _for developers_, which is why the Python section of the learning path is considered a prerequisite.

### 2. New Dashboard View

![new boot.dev dashboard view](/img/800/dashboardscreenshot.png.webp)

In the past, the backend learning path page kinda _doubled_ as a dashboard view. It was a frankenstein thing where we it acted as a landing page for the learning path, but also tried to show you your progress, achievements, items, etc.

We've done away with that! Each learning path (of which there are now 2, of course) has its own page, but its really just a landing page of sorts for the path. An info page, if you will.

The new dashboard view is your default page when you log in to Boot.dev, and it's designed to be a much more focused view into your progress, your goals, where you've been, where you're going, etc. For example, it has your streak, quests and potions front and center so that each time you start a session, you know where you stand.

### 3. Leagues

Way back when, the [Leaderboard](https://www.boot.dev/leaderboard) was actually the favorite "game mechanic" on the platform, at least according to most of our community members. As Boot.dev has grown so fast in popularity, it's become... less and less useful.

The trouble is that there are so many people on the platform now, that the leaderboard is dominated by experienced developers speedrunning the courses for fun. It doesn't give the _new_ learners a chance.

**Leagues fix this**. When you hit level 10, you'll join a new league _for the next 4 weeks_. Your league only has 25 learners in it, and your leaderboard is scoped _mostly_ to your league. This means that you can actually compete with your peers, and not just the top 10% of the platform. Your league also resets, so in the chance that you got stuck with someone who is just crushing it, you get a fresh start the next month.

### 4. Spellbook UI Update

We've been listening intently to all the feedback about spellbooks, and have made some big UI/UX changes. See, spellbooks have turned out to be incredibly popular (remember, they're essentially unlockable, searchable cheatsheets). The trouble has been that once you have more than ~30 pages, it got hard to find what you were looking for.

The new spellbook UI looks like this:

![new bootdev spellbook ui](/img/800/spellbookuiupdate.png.webp)

Notable changes are:

- The lesson that unlocked the page is shown next to the page title
- You can filter by language/technology
- By default all pages are shown, and you can paginate through them, the searchbar just changes the order of the pages, surfacing what you want more quickly

### 5. New course catalogue page

Now that we have two learning paths, we needed a single place to search _all_ the content on the platform. The new [Course Catalogue](https://www.boot.dev/courses) solves this. It's a simple page with all the courses that you can search and filter.

### 6. Miscellaneous improvements

- Optional lessons have been made required
- `bootdev` CLI speed improvements
- Checkbox in-lesson interactions are simpler and more intuitive
- New visuals for "danger", "warn", "tip", and "info" callouts in lesson text

## What is yet to come

- League UI/UX updates
- A "build an AI agent" guided project
- A new product... that is totally secret for now, but that has _something_ to do with optional challenges being removed
- Walkthroughs of the JS/TS courses

## New YouTube Videos

We publish our explainer videos and course walkthroughs on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bootdotdev?sub_confirmation=1) for _free_! Here are the latest videos:
