I'm happy to announce that today we launched our new [Learn SQL course](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-sql)! It was a ton of fun to write, but I also had a blast building the back-end infrastructure that allows students to write and execute SQL in the browser. If you've been wanting to gain a solid foundation of SQL skills, this course is for you!

## What's in the course?

You'll learn all the fundamentals of SQL in this 11-chapter course. The instructions will all in an image + text format, but the cool part is that on each assignment you'll be writing and running real SQLite queries in your browser! No need to set up a local database environment and install a client. The 11 chapters are:

* What is SQL?
* Tables
* Constraints
* CRUD operations (how databases play a role in web apps)
* Basic Queries
* Structuring Data
* Aggregations
* Subqueries
* Normalization
* Joins
* Performance

This course really rounds out our entire back-end path - all the major pieces are there! Of course, we'll still be adding to and updating the content regularly, but this SQL course was a big "missing piece".

## What does it cost?

At the time of release, the first 3 chapters of the course are free. After that, you can [become a member](https://boot.dev/pricing) to unlock full access for $34/mo!
