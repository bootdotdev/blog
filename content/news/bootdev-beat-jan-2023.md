If you can't tell from my absurd profile photo below, I've been having too much fun with AI art this month.

I hope you're having a great start to the year, and you're reaching all your coding goals! Boot.dev has grown like crazy this month, we're quickly becoming the #1 place to learn modern back-end development! I'm just excited to be here.

All the best, Lane

## What we've done this month

### [1. "Learn Cryptography" course released](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-cryptography-golang)

Okay, technically we re-released it, but this new course is so much better than the old one. Allan and I have learned a lot about making awesome courses. If you're interested in cryptography, DevSecOps, or cyber security, and have already taken our [Learn Go course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-golang), you should hit this up for sure.

### 2. Tries and heaps chapters added

We added 2 new chapters to the [Learn Data Structures](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-data-structures-python) and [Learn Advanced Algorithms](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-algorithms-2-python) courses: tries and heaps.

### 3. Better gem store experience

Last month we released an update to the game system that enables you to use gems to buy XP boosts, and to recover your sharpshooter progress if you lose it. While that was awesome, it wasn't obvious how to do it, so we've improved that experience. You can read about the [details of the game here](https://blog.boot.dev/wiki/the-game/).

## What we're working on now

- My wife is scheduled to give birth to our son on Feb 8th, so February is gonna be a bit slow, but Allan will still be working like a dog.
- We want to do a major upgrade of the "Learn Functional Programming" course, but we're still working out some details on the direction we want to take with it.
- "Deploy an API" will probably be our next course/project, though we're also working on other ideas like "Learn Kubernetes" and "Learn Networking"
- So many of you have done the challenges in the Learn Python course! We're working to integrate the challenges directly into the course so that you don't need to tab out and back in to get to them. Once we're more satisfied with that experience, we'll be adding more challenges to other courses.
