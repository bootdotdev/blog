The training grounds are LIVE! 21,000 challenges have been generated between the launch and as I write this, and we're just getting started. Big things to come.

Gratefully,
Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. Training Grounds is Live

{{< bdyoutube GxN3aWszGU4 >}}

The [Training Grounds](https://www.boot.dev/training) solves the problem of "I need more practice challenges, these courses are moving too fast!"

You can generate personalized practice challenges (both coding challenges and Boots interview challenges) anytime from the training grounds, and they're automatically tailored to where you are in your journey. It looks at things like:

- What courses you've completed
- What topics you've learned recently
- What you've been struggling with
- What might need to be reviewed based on time elapsed ([spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition))

You can also share challenges and practice on the challenges that others have generated - coming soon we'll allow you to browse the library of highly-rated challenges so you don't have to wait to generate your own if you don't want to.

### 2. Boots' Interview Lessons

We're introducing an entirely new type of interactive lesson: the Boots interview! It's _kinda_ like a multiple choice question... but much better for learning. You're asked an open-ended question by Boots, and then you chat back and forth with him interview-style until he's satisfied that you've covered the points that the instructor wanted to be sure you understood.

Right now it's mostly used in the Training Grounds, but we'll be adding more of these types of lessons to the regular courses as well.

### 3. HTTP Protocol Course Walkthrough

ThePrimeagen recently released a full walkthrough of his ["TCP to HTTP" Golang course (Learn the HTTP Protocol)](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-protocol-golang) on YouTube! It's a tough course, so feel free to use his walkthrough as a guide if you're stuck!

### 4. AI Agent Course Walkthrough

We _also_ launched a walkthrough of our [AI Agent course in Python](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-ai-agent-python) on FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel, so be sure to check that out!
