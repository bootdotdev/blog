We couldn't be more excited to announce the latest update to [boot.dev](https://boot.dev/), the achievements system! We've modeled our achievements after how StarCraft II, DotA 2, Overwatch, and other video games handle tier systems. Each time a student unlocks an achievement they also get some free gems and a pretty badge on their [public developer portfolio.](https://boot.dev/u/wagslane) Gems can be thought of as style points for now... though we plan to do something interesting with them in the future.

We've currently have three kinds of achievements:

- Streaks
- Speed
- Devotion

Each kind of achievement has five tiers, from lowest to highest:

- Bronze
- Silver
- Gold
- Platinum
- Diamond

## Streak Acheivements

Streaks are earned by completing many exercises in a row correctly without submitting any wrong answers. Currently the bronze streak requires 10 exercises in a row and earns 25 gems, while the silver streak requires 20 exercises and has a reward of 75 gems.

It's important to note that boot.dev still rewards gems directly for each step of the streak, but now achievements are given at larger intervals in addition to those bonuses.

## Speed Acheivements

Speed achievements are unlocked by completing a certain number of exercises within a certain timeframe. For example, at the time of writing the bronze achievement requires the completion of 10 exercises in 5 minutes.

## Devotion Achievements

The primary goal of devotion achievements is to help students stay motivates and engaged, and to not give up on their coding journey. Students are awarded for completing exercises for a given number of days in a row. For example, the gold devotion achievement rewards 300 free gems if a student completes at least one exercise daily for a month.
