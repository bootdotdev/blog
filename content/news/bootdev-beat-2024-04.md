Pythogoras returned in our second community-wide boss battle. He was vanquished, and there was much rejoicing. Happy coding.

Respectfully, Lane

## Patch notes

### 1. New Project: Static Site Generator

![ssg project](/img/800/build-ssg.png.webp)

This new guided project comes directly after the functional programming course. You'll build a simple static site generator in Python: it works similarly to Jekyll or Hugo. This is a tough project, but it's a great way to learn about file I/O, templating, and to put your new object-oriented and functional programming skills to the test.

### 2. Updates to Bosses + New Lore

The purpose of all our game mechanics is to encourage great learning habits. As such, we needed to make some updates...

* Boss battle achievements are no longer competitive, instead, they're based on the total number of bosses you've helped to defeat. We plan to do boss battles on a semi-random schedule every 4-8 weeks.
* Bosses are defeated as the community gains XP. We removed the "damage" mechanic, it felt redundant.
* You now get a static XP bonus as the event goes along, and it's based on how many fellow learners are participating.
* We've added a live feed of the boss's health and the community's progress in the event.

### 3. Profile heatmaps

Your public profile page now includes a GitHub-style heatmap of all your accomplishments on Boot.dev. You can also sync a GitHub account and it will show GitHub commits as well.

### 4. Miscellaneous improvements

* Added 20+ optional challenges to the Learn Go course.
* Big update to the OOP course
* Big update to the algorithms course
* More sidebar menus open as models so you don't lose your place in the course
* Profile page leads much faster
* The leaderboard has a live feed of lessons being completed, as well as a full redesign

## What is yet to come

* New Course: "Learn Pub/Sub Architecture"
* Chests (loot boxes) as the new primary reward system (don't worry, no microtransactions)
* Baked Salmon, Seer Stones, and Potions to round out our shop of consumables
* New Course: "Learn Memory Management in C"
* New Course: "Learn Git"
