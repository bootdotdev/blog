The [Qvault app](https://app.qvault.io/) - our new gamified learning platform - just launched its first [JavaScript coding course](https://qvault.io/basic-intro-to-coding-course/)! This one is short, sweet, and to the point. We created a thirty-exercise, two-module course that caters to students who have never seen a single line of code before. That's right, this is a code-in-the-browser course for absolute beginners.

## What is Taught?

The course is made of 80% code completion exercises and 20% multiple-choice questions.

Some of the concepts covered include:

- Variables
- Printing
- Mathematical Operations
- Loops

We use JavaScript throughout the course for two reasons:

- JavaScript is an [interpreted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language#:~:text=An%20interpreted%20language%20is%20a,program%20into%20machine%2Dlanguage%20instructions.), dynamically typed language. This means we can leave some of the lower-level details for later courses and focus on more interesting concepts immediately.
- JavaScript is extremely popular and one of the most-used programming languages. JavaScript tends to be a language that junior developers are able to find a job using quickly.

## What's Next?

One of the next courses in our pipeline is a direct sequel to "(_Very) Basic Intro to Coding_". We need to cover other core coding concepts like:

- Functions
- Objects
- Scope
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Deno](https://deno.land/)

## What If I'm Not a Beginner?

That's great! Qvaults focus is on computer science fundamentals, and many of our courses are for more experiences developers.
