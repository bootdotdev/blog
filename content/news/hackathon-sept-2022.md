## The project – A Python 3 application using PokeAPI data

I'm not going to share too many details yet (because you're not allowed to start until after the kickoff). Just know that two of the constraints will be:

* The application must be written in Python 3
* The application must somehow make use of PokeAPI data. Make a Pokemon app!

## Prizes

We’ll have two categories of participants.

* Those who have been programming for *less* than a year
* Those who have been programming for *more* than a year

There will be 3 winners and 1 "1st place" winner from each category.

* First place winners will get a $50 gift card! This will likely be to Amazon, Apple, Visa, etc. We'll do what's most convenient for you.
* The top 3 will all win a copy of "[Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)" - a fantastic Python book

In addition, everyone who participates will earn 1000XP in the Boot.dev app, and get a coupon code for 25% off of a membership.
