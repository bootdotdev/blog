JavaScript is one of those things that if you're not a programmer you'll touch a thousand times every single day, but never know you're doing it. It's everywhere!

JavaScript makes interactive web pages. That's it. But it's one of the [most highly sought-after programming languages](https://towardsdatascience.com/javascript-for-data-analysis-2e8e7dbf63a7), with one of the highest salaries. It's ubiquitous, so it's not only good to learn how, but also kind of fun. If you know JavaScript, you feel a little bit like you're peeking behind the veil of the world wide web.

I read a lot of articles on beginner projects for JavaScript and I don't like them for various reasons. Some encouraged people to do the tic-tac-toe game, which is a little boring. Some just said, "You should try to make a blog with JavaScript!" but then didn't actually offer any instructions.

This guide is going to be what I wish I had when I started learning JavaScript. These are fun, interesting, slightly challenging JavaScript projects for beginners. They're going to require a little bit more than copy-paste-enter, but when you do them, you'll have a much greater feeling of satisfaction.

I highly recommend projects in general as a way to learn to code: they're more hands-on and can be more rewarding than watching a lecture or reading a textbook. Interactive learning by actually doing the coding is more effective for faster learning than lecture. The learning curve can feel steeper, but the skills you learn will be much stickier.

JavaScript has a bunch of different frameworks (we’ll get into what frameworks are in a second), so I'm going to section this article into vanilla JavaScript, Vue.js, and Angular. All of these are free JavaScript projects - all you’ll need to invest is your time.

Ready for 17 complex, interesting, and fun JavaScript practice projects for beginners? Let's jump in.

## Section 1: Vanilla JavaScript Projects for Beginners

A framework is basically a prepackaged chunk of code that does something specific. Think of it like a cheat, or a shortcut. Frameworks come and go, but JavaScript stays forever! That's why I wanted to start with some vanilla, simple JavaScript projects for beginners. These don’t rely on any frameworks.

### 1. Build a weather app.

I want to start with the weather app because I believe it's genuinely useful and has a chance of being used in your day-to-day life. [This tutorial](https://www.studytonight.com/post/how-to-build-a-weather-app-using-javascript-for-complete-beginners) that I'm linking to is perfect for beginners because it's going to help you understand the core basics of the DOM and teach you how to use the fetch API to call and get data from a third-party service.

The app tutorial will walk you through building a location-based weather app. Based on your current location, the app will show you the weather there.

**Warning:** the tutorial _says_ that the prerequisites are [basic HTML, basic CSS, and basic JavaScript](/javascript/html-css-javascript/), but they also link to the guides to all those below. I really believe that the best learning is taught by doing, so feel free to check it out, read the guides if you have to, or just get stuck in.

### 2. Build a landing page for your website.

Building a whole website is a massive endeavor. Let’s start with one of the small JavaScript projects for beginners instead: a landing page. If you want to get a job using JavaScript, it's always a good idea to have your own website built using JavaScript. [This YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSTQzlprGLI) is 35 minutes long and will teach you to build a home page or landing page that you can interact with, and save your name/focus to local storage.

The guy making the videos has 1.62 million subscribers and tons of positive comments. I found his teaching style to be really engaging and straightforward. He also offers the full code so you can check it out and poke around for yourself.

### 3. Build a restaurant menu page 

Maybe I'm hungry as I write this because this is the first of several food-based tutorials we're going to be looking at. In fact, of my top 10 JavaScript projects for beginners, solidly half would be food-related. 

[This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&t=8185s) is one of 15 total tutorials from a YouTube video called build 15 easy JavaScript projects walking through vanilla JavaScript. It takes you through how to make a restaurant menu page that will filter through different food menus. 

It'll teach you the higher-order functions like map, reduce, and filter. Higher-order functions are great to learn because they have really high reusability, so you'll get to code smarter, not harder.

### 4. Complete a course

JavaScript ideas for beginners don’t only have to come in video or article form. If you've looked at the three tutorials above and you’re kind of feeling lost, there's no shame in learning JavaScript with some help -- such as by an interactive course that you gradually build up your skills with as you progress through lessons and modules.

That's why we built our first course -- our [Intro to JavaScript course](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-javascript). It's completely free to start and audit, and takes you from complete beginner and teaches you the skills you need to progress as a programmer. And what's more, you learn by interactively coding through lessons as you code your very own JavaScript game, and a variety of other fun yet useful projects.

It's one of the best JavaScript projects you can complete for your future career, too, as completing the course earns you a certificate that you can share with recruiters and embed into your CV.

### 5. Make a grocery list

Back to the food. This basic javascript project tutorial will teach you to update and delete items from a grocery list, which walks you through the process of creating a simple CRUD. (CRUD just means create, read, update, and delete.)

It’s actually [another project](https://boot.dev/learn/learn-javascript) from the same person who did the restaurant menu page tutorial, so maybe he was hungry as well.  If you’ve got the time and inclination I really recommend checking out all eight hours of his 15 JavaScript projects. It's the kind of content that I can't believe he gives away for free, it’s so in-depth and valuable.

### 6. Create a platformer game

I don't know about you, but I definitely had an angry bird phase. If you've ever wanted to make your own platformer game [this great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-OKdSHRlfA) JavaScript project tutorial is for you. This tutorial runs you through the concept of object-oriented programming, and the model, view, controller software pattern. You'll pick up a lot of concepts in this tutorial like for loops, switch statements, and OOP principles.

It's definitely one of the longer tutorials - this one goes on for nearly three hours. But it's super well-organized and laid out, so you won't only have a really cool game at the end of it, you'll really understand a lot of the underlying principles of JavaScript.

## Section 2: Vue.js JavaScript Projects for Beginners

There are so many different frameworks you can use that do very similar or overlapping things in JavaScript. Vue.js is one of them. Vue.js is great for making applications and interactive user interfaces.

While React does a similar thing and is more popular (and some would say more useful) in the long run, Vue.js is billed for beginners so that's why I chose it for this section. This section contains six JavaScript projects for learning Vue.js.

### 7. Recipes app

Yes, we're back on food JavaScript projects. If you love cooking, or if you're disorganized and struggle to keep all your recipes in one place, [this recipes app](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-build-a-recipe-app-using-vue-js-and-vuex-7830998050b9) is a great tutorial for JavaScript beginners. There are three elements for this app: the listing with all the recipes, a form to add a new recipe, and a detailed view of the selected recipe. (It's also full of tantalizing pictures of chicken fajita pasta.)

It uses a lot of frameworks - you'll be using vue2, vuex, vuetify, and Cosmic.js. It's definitely on the more ambitious side of JavaScript projects for beginners. But it'll create something really cool, beautiful, and potentially useful. 

### 8. News Website

If you like to keep up-to-date in these trying times, good for you. [Here's a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wPClWnmmCc) that will teach you to build a news web application with Vue.js. 

This tutorial uses the API from newsapi.org. It's definitely more self-guided than some of the other tutorials on this list - the video just shows the guy typing and he doesn't explain anything - but I still found it useful. 

Especially compared to some of the other tutorials above, this one's on the shorter side only: 16 minutes. If you like this guy, you'll be pleased to hear that he has [a whole playlist of 14 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLINmvGGUwYc3fsN0ba_ZSZE0ywDeS0cd2) of JavaScript starter projects for learning how to use Vue.js. 

### 9. To-do app

I love [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLINmvGGUwYc3fsN0ba_ZSZE0ywDeS0cd2) because it's short, sweet, and simple. The creator, CJ, writes really clean and easy-to-understand code, so it’s great to learn from.

If you want a JavaScript project for beginners that will help you stay on top of things, this tutorial will show you how to create a to-do app. Throughout the process, you'll also learn the core concepts of Vue.js.

 I also quite like CJ's mustache. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WFNGiaMIsDIZihUhO3Y6fd5W7xihd13JRfJ6pROitd6sFRLM5gPa0LuoPYNLEkQWvG1JtCwmn_-oCk4ucIMFZsDz-qjBSHoWgD5J-pR9RBrGJYnBDuOT7ApB5oi0YwVAPVWuftW1=s0)

### 10. User reg and login

[This tutorial](https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2018/07/14/vue-vuex-user-registration-and-login-tutorial-example) walks you through how to build a simple user registration and login system. Just like Python \[link to Python projects for beginners\], being able to create a login is a great project because it's a pretty necessary job. If you want to get into JavaScript careers, you'll be doing this. 

You can read the article I linked above, and you can also check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cornflourblue/vue-vuex-registration-login-example) that has all the details.

### 11. Trello clone 

A great way to learn to code JavaScript for beginners is to create clones of things that already exist. That's why I recommend this tutorial which teaches you to build a Trello clone built with Vue.js. You have a target you can aim for, so you can see what needs tweaking or even improving! I love Trello, and use it practically every day, so I found this tutorial really interesting.

[This tutorial](https://github.com/zackthoutt/vue-trello) is heavy on learn-by-doing and low on guidance, so keep that in mind as you dive into the GitHub repo.

### 12. Temperature converter app

When I was eighteen, I moved to England and found that everybody there uses Celsius. Did I know what 18 degrees C felt like? Absolutely not. This confusion led to me dressing either very warmly or very coldly for the weather. (I could have Googled it, but I was lazy.)

This temperature converter website tutorial could have saved me that pain. I love [this tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/temperature-converter-website-atx32dy7mf), because it will show you several different solutions that other developers implemented, what tools they used, and how they did it. If you're more interested in mobile apps, you can see the [tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/projects/temperature-converter-mobile-app-atx32h5e71) on how to build a temperature converter there instead.

## Section 3: Angular JavaScript Projects for Beginners 

Angular is both a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It's good for scalability. I've added it to the end of this list because it'll probably be something that really only dedicated JavaScript beginners want to look at, but it is really worth getting familiar with. It shores up a lot of JavaScript’s weaknesses for single-page applications, which are only getting more popular.

Because Angular is a more complex concept, I've kept most of these tutorials on the simpler side of things.

### 13. Build an audio player

This is the kind of project that would be very difficult with vanilla JavaScript. However Angular and Angular Materials make it a little easier to tackle these challenges.

[This tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/building-an-audio-player-app-with-angular-and-rxjs/#Conclusion) would probably be beyond the reach of most JavaScript beginners, except that it's so well-written and detailed that anybody can pick this up.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have developed an audio player app. You will have handled audio operations and application state. You also have even secured your application using Auth0. The writer of the tutorial also included all his code on [his GitHub repo](https://github.com/imsingh/auth0-audio/).

### 14. Bare Bones 

Remember how I said I don't like Hello World projects?

[This](https://github.com/DanWahlin/Angular-BareBones) JavaScript project for beginners is the one exception. Especially since Angular can be tricky to get to grips with, this barebones project is kind of like a starter pack for angular. I think of this as the hello world project with a few more bells and whistles.

It's a GitHub repo with a very short readme file and has the npm modules, configuration, scripts, folders, and routing in place. It's a minimal app - perfect for poking around. Get it up, get it running, and see where you go next.

### 15. Budget calculator 

I'm a little weird in that I love doing my budget. Every Sunday morning, I sit down and fill out my budget spreadsheet. That's why this budget calculator application using Angular was so appealing to me. 

[The tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU4z4Ti-8OQ&t=3s) is about two hours long and focuses on designing the user interface. It covers topics like Angular forms, displaying dialogues, and component interaction. Like any self-respecting coding tutorial creator, he also linked to [his GitHub repo](https://github.com/Devstackr/budget-app-angular) for that project. JavaScript projects with example code are the best to learn from.

I find it a visually appealing app - it’s very satisfying to make these kinds of applications that look and feel smooth to use, especially once you know what’s behind the curtain.![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CmsdLukeIXt23yd4MvAS06A_C6tkrnZ-DoiLWVRAaJuy_yA5WTKx7qvYznFR4wwxerOYsogsUvaPBo59udohRPhImBDzLKif_0xNGZI4SQjtgMzqmdRquDilbtTNWX9aPJXNvrSt=s0)

[Screenshot from the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU4z4Ti-8OQ&t=3s)

### 16. Create a Google map powered by Angular

Who doesn't love maps? [This tutorial](https://blog.ng-book.com/angular-and-google-maps-a-tutorial/) teaches you to create interactive Google Maps powered by Angular. That's a pretty cool idea! 

The tutorial walks you through instantiating the map, geocoding by address and location, working with markers, and programmatically adjusting the radii (plural for radius, of course) of circles for location. There’s also [a GitHub repo](https://github.com/bodrovis/GoogleMapsAngular) where you can snag the code. 

The written tutorial is pretty comprehensive. It runs at about a 9-minute read, but of course, you'll spend much longer implementing the code. I love this tutorial because it gave you all the code, but also explained what the code was doing, why it was important, and even how you could tweak it yourself.

### 17. The front end of a personal blog

Having a personal blog is something I am very passionate about. I believe anybody can benefit from creating a blog. Most of us use Squarespace or WordPress, but you can also do it with Angular. This is one of the best projects you can do with JavaScript.

[This](https://soshace.com/how-to-create-a-personal-blogging-website-part-2/) [tutorial](https://soshace.com/how-to-create-a-personal-blogging-website-part-2/) walks you through creating the front end of a personal blog. It's a little beyond what I would consider beginner, but it's still a great passion project. It's something you can work on more than one, with no real end date. You can also use your personal blog as a portfolio of sorts.

The style of this written tutorial assumes that you don't know anything. That's why I like it for beginners, even though creating the front end of your blog is pretty advanced.

## These seventeen JavaScript projects for beginners are a good place to start

There are so many more libraries and frameworks beyond what I've provided you in this article, but this is a good starting point for beginners. I referred to a couple of other frameworks that you might be interested in checking out throughout the course of this article. As you dive deeper into JavaScript, you'll be exposed to more and more of these. There are practically countless small JavaScript projects for practice you can find, using any of the frameworks that appeal to you.

JavaScript is an amazing language to learn, whether you're a beginner programmer or a seasoned coating better end. As the internet plays a bigger role in our lives, the foundations that it is built on are remarkably interesting to learn about. These projects allow you to look a little bit behind the curtain, and learn about the websites you look at every single day. 

These great JavaScript practice projects can all be tricky to do. I'm not going to pretend they're simple, but that's what makes them so great. When you complete this project, you'll have built something you're proud of. There's no better feeling in the world.
