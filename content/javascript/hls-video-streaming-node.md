In this quick tutorial, we'll build a robust video (or music) streaming API using Node JS. Donâ€™t worry, it's surprisingly easy since we will be utilizing a modern protocol, [HTTP Live Streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming), or HLS.

## Why use HLS for video streaming?

HLS allows us to serve large media files as many smaller files. We will use a program to convert a single `.mp3` file into several text files that can be served by a typical _NodeJS_ file server. There are a few advantages to this:

- User's video/song loads quickly
- The majority of unwatched or unlistened-to portions of the song won't be downloaded
- We can use the familiar HTTP protocol, which means less server and client configuration

## First Step - FFMPEG

[FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) will convert mp3 files to HLS format, which is really a bunch of files. The main HLS file is the `.m3u8` file, and the URL that will be given to the streaming client will be the path to this file. This `.m3u8` metadata file tells the client where to find each data (.ts) file. Data files typically contain small chunks of media data (~10 seconds) and are fetched at the client's request as the user progresses through the song or video.

Let's format some media.

Install [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). If you are on a Mac:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

Navigate to the directory of the mp4 file and run FFMPEG:

```bash
ffmpeg -i sample-mp4-file.mp4 -profile:v baseline -level 3.0 -s 640x360 -start_number 0 -hls_time 10 -hls_list_size 0 -f hls index.m3u8
```

This will create some new files in the same directory:

```
index.m3u8
index0.ts
index1.ts
index2.ts
index3.ts
index4.ts
index5.ts
index6.ts
index7.ts
index8.ts
index9.ts
index10.ts
index11.ts
index12.ts
```

That's the worst part! Now we just need to setup a Node server that can serve these files over HTTP.

## Setting Up Node.JS

Let's setup a project with the following folder structure:

![](/img/800/Screen-Shot-2020-07-28-at-8.24.48-AM.png)

`main.js` is in the root of the project along with the _videos_ folder.

`main.js` should contain the following code:

```js
var http = require('http');
var fs = require('fs');

const port = 8080

http.createServer(function (request, response) {
    console.log('request starting...');

    var filePath = '.' + request.url;

    fs.readFile(filePath, function(error, content) {
        response.writeHead(200, { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*' });
        if (error) {
            if(error.code == 'ENOENT'){
                fs.readFile('./404.html', function(error, content) {
                    response.end(content, 'utf-8');
                });
            }
            else {
                response.writeHead(500);
                response.end('Sorry, check with the site admin for error: '+error.code+' ..\n');
                response.end(); 
            }
        }
        else {
            response.end(content, 'utf-8');
        }
    });

}).listen(port);
console.log(`Server running at http://127.0.0.1:${port}/`);
```

Run your server:

```bash
node main.js
```

Then use [this public tool](https://hls-js-dev.netlify.app/demo/) to make stream your video to the browser.

All done! You can now stream video with Node.JS. The server we built is a very simple example, but you can serve these files in any way you want as long as its over HTTP. The thing that matters is that each path in `index.m3u8` is consistent with the actual URLs of each data file.
