## Who is Boot.dev for?

While anyone will find at least a couple of our coding courses directly applicable to their current situation, you will get the most out of our platform if you’ve been coding for a little while but are in the process of finding your first dev job.

Our [curriculum](https://github.com/bootdotdev/curriculum) is computer science-focused, and if you work through it, the glass ceiling of “entry-level programming jobs” will shatter for you. Our computer science curriculum takes you through the concepts you’d find in a university-quality CS degree.

## I’ve never written code before, is Boot.dev for me?

Yes! While many of our students are developers looking to round out their computer science education, we’ve built our curriculum to start from ground zero. In fact, by starting with computer science and not just web development, you’re doing it right. Finding a job will be much easier for you.

## What are achievements and gems? How do I earn them?

If you’re a patron achievements and gems are awarded as you complete certain milestones in your courses. For example, speed achievements are unlocked when you complete many exercises in a short timeframe. Devotion achievements are gained by logging in daily to work on courses. Streaks are unlocked by getting many assignments correct in a row.

You can use the gems you earn to unlock cheats and hints or to tip helpful members of the Discord community.

## How do I get my certificates?

If you are a patron, you go into your settings and customize your profile, and that profile is accessible to the public via the portfolio tab. Your portfolio has links to all the certificates you’ve earned.

If you want to show off your work to a potential employer or on your resume, just drop a link to your Boot.dev portfolio. To see an example, you can check out [Lane’s portfolio here](https://boot.dev/u/wagslane).

## Can I get in touch?

Of course! Check out our [contact page](/contact) for details.

## Can I become a partner and help grow Boot.dev?

Yes! We have an [affiliate partner program](/affiliates)! You’ll earn money each time someone you refer signs up. It takes minutes to get started and is a great way to monetize a social following or blog you host. Read more about it and get started here.
