If you can't find the answer to your question here, please [contact us](/contact/).

## How long will it take to learn enough to be hired?

It's completely up to you. The time it will take you to be "job ready" will depend on how much you already know, how often you study, and how long you study for. That said, the backend career path takes many people [about 12 months.](/backend/how-long-to-become-backend-dev/)

## Should I include Boot.dev projects in my resume and portfolio?

Absolutely! If you built it, use it. You'll build several personal projects while completing our curriculum, and our final course about finding jobs will show you how to construct a job-ready portfolio.

## What is Boot.dev? A bootcamp? An online school?

- We're not a $10,000 bootcamp.
- We're not a $50,000 university degree.

We are a self-paced, gamified online learning platform for back-end web development. You can learn with us for the price of a gym membership.

## What will I get as a member?

You can demo the first few chapters of each course as a guest, but after that you'll be in "guest mode" or "read only" mode. In guest mode you won't be able to complete assignments, take quizzes, or do the interactive parts of the courses. As a paid member you get access to everything.

## What makes Boot.dev different?

You can read all about [our methodology here.](/about/) In a nutshell, we're laser focused on teaching backend-development, which is somewhat of a rarity in online learning. We're also focused on solving what we believe is the hardest problem with online learning: boredom. If you prefer coding rather than watching, and your struggle with online learning is staying motivated and engaged, we think you'll like learning with us.

## Can I cancel my membership?

We absolutely [hate dark patterns](https://wagslane.dev/posts/dark-patterns/), so we've made it easy to cancel your subscription any time. You can cancel your membership any time from your [settings page](https://www.boot.dev?modal=settings) and you won't be billed again.

## Do you offer refunds?

If for any reason you feel you aren't getting enough value out of the platform, we don't want your money. We have a simple [return policy.](/return-policy/) Just [contact us](/contact/) within 30 days of your purchase you're entitled to a full refund.

## Do you offer discounts for purchasing power parity?

Yes! We believe in being as fair as possible to learners around the world, and that means pricing that reflects respective earning power. If you're seeing pricing in anything other than USD, then you're already seeing discounted pricing for your country. If you're not seeing discounted pricing, but you are from a country with lower purchasing power, please [let us know](/contact/) and we'll get you a discount.

## Can my employer pay for my membership?

Absolutely! We have team plans that let your manager pay for your membership and those of your team, while managing billing all in one place. To get started just check out [the teams page](https://www.boot.dev?modal=teams). You'll need to be logged in.

## Can I buy a Boot.dev membership for someone else?

For sure, just check out [the gifts page](https://www.boot.dev/gifts). You'll be able to purchase a redeemable code that you can give to a friend.

## My card is getting declined, what can I do?

This is almost always because your bank is rejecting international transactions (we are based in the United States and use Stripe for payments). You should be able to contact the customer service department of your credit card company or your Bank and get the transactions approved or your card unlocked.
