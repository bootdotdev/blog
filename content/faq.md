## Who is Boot.dev for?

While anyone who's interested in coding will likely find at least a couple of our courses directly applicable to their current situation, you will get the most out of our platform if you’re interested in learning how to upskill as a back-end developer. Whether you're just starting your coding journey, or you're transitioning from an IT, Ops, or QA job into development, we've got a great program for you.

Our [curriculum](https://github.com/bootdotdev/curriculum) is a computer-science based approach to learning back-end development. If you complete all the courses and projects you can shatter the glass ceiling of "entry-level programming jobs". Our courses teach you through the same fundamentals you would learn in a university's CS degree.

## I’ve never written code before, is Boot.dev for me?

Yes! We’ve built our curriculum to start from zero with the "Learn Python" course. It assumes you know nothing about code.

## How do I get my certificates?

If you are a member, you go into your settings and customize your profile, and that profile is accessible to the public via the portfolio tab. Your portfolio has links to all the certificates you’ve earned.

If you want to show off your work to a potential employer or on your resume, just drop a link to your Boot.dev portfolio. To see an example, you can check out [Lane’s portfolio here](https://boot.dev/u/wagslane).

## Can I get in touch?

Of course! Check out our [contact page](/contact) for details.

## Can I become a partner and help grow Boot.dev?

Yes! We have an [affiliate partner program](/affiliates)! You’ll earn money each time someone you refer signs up. It takes minutes to get started and is a great way to monetize a social following or blog you host. Read more about it and get started here.
