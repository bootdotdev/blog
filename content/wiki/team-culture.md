- Our mission statement: **To make learning backend engineering skills as fun and simple as it can be.**
- Our vision statement? We don't have one because they're dumb.

## What values inform our culture?

Integrity? Honesty? Excellence? Teamwork? _Gross._

Companies that use a handful of truisms as their "values" don't actually have values. It's not a value unless you're willing to sacrifice some _other_ good thing to uphold it. Here are some specific things we do care about:

- Quantity is the enemy of quality
- Perfect is the enemy of done
- Boring is the enemy of learning
- Aptitude and passion matter more than experience
- Flexible working hours, but lots of em

## Quantity is the enemy of quality

We're _much_ more concerned about quality than quantity. It's impossible to compete with Udemy, YouTube, etc on the amount of programming content we can produce. Instead, we're building the _best possible experience_ for learning backend engineering skills, not the _largest repository_ of content.

## Perfect is the enemy of done

We ship often, and occasionally we ship a bug, but we measure how long it takes to fix (noticable) bugs in _minutes or hours_ not _weeks_. We launch new features as MVPs. The meat is there, it works, and it improves the product, but not every additional bell and whistle is tacked on. We iterate quickly and kill our darlings.

## Boring is the enemy of learning

There is a _lot_ of programming content out there. There is a lot of _accurate_ programming content out there. There is a lot of _well explained_ programming content out there.

There's not a lot of all of the above that's also incredibly _fun_ and _hands on_. We won't ship a course until its fun and interactive.

## Aptitude, passion, then experience

We care about these things, in this order:

1. Aptitude
2. Passion & work ethic
3. Experience & skills

The easiest thing to correct for is a lack of skills. The best people can pick up new skills. They're relentless. They don't throw up their hands and say "I don't know how to do that", they go learn how to do it, or find people who can help them.

On the contrary, if we don't have smart, hard-working people, that's hard to fix. Similarly, it's hard (but not impossible) to get yourself to be excited about coding education if you're not already, so it's best to just start with people who love what we're doing.

## Flexible working time, but not less time

I use the term "work life integration" instead of "work life balance". Work-life balance is often thought of as the ability to put away your laptop at 5PM and not think about work until 8AM the next day. The ability to take a week-long vacation each year. Separating work and life. That works for some organizations, and if that's your preferred method, you might want to go find one of them. It doesn't work for us.

We have unlimited PTO. We have flexible hours. We all work remote. We don't care which hours you work (I go to the gym at 10AM because it's not busy) but we care _a lot_ that you're getting stuff done and that you're responsive to your teammates. Flexible time, but not _less_ time.

We don't believe on any time tracking or micro-managing techniques for remote work. You'll be evaluated on your results, and on your ability to work with the team, not on when or for how long you're working.
