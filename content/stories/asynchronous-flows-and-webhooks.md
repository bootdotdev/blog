In this post, we'll be talking about coding with a common integration pattern with an external API called a 
*webhook*. Loosely speaking, there are three main types of communication you'll see when building an 
application.

1. Frontend to Backend.
2. Your backend to an external backend (API).
3. An external backend to your backend (API).

![External Backend to Backend (with Webhook)](/img/800/asynchronous-flows-and-webhooks-2.png)

When first learning to code, we focus largely on the first two.  However, in practice, the third type, commonly known as
a **webhook**, is also prevalent.  Before we get started, let's settle on some terminology.

## What is an asynchronous flow and why are they important?

Let's start first with what you probably already know.  When you send an HTTP request to an API and expect an immediate
response, that is a **synchronous call**. Your code _waits_ for the API to respond, and ties up resources on your
server while it is servicing that request.  The resources tied up differs depending on your language and web framework,
but typically a thread is tied up, or at the very least CPU time and RAM are consumed while waiting.

While this is sufficient for most applications, eventually you will come across a scenario where synchronous 
communication does not fit the bill.  Some examples:

1. The request you sent to the external API is computationally expensive - waiting for a synchronous response will
result in a timeout, which depending on the platform is typically between 10 and 30 seconds. 
2. The external API or platform will not have an immediate answer for your request.  A common use case here would be a 
workflow requiring a human on the other side to complete a task before responding to you.

An asynchronous flow is any type of 
communication between two parties that is not immediate. You might send a request to an API and get an immediate 
response, but you will not get any data of good use (don't worry if this doesn't seem to make sense now, we'll explain 
further in the example below). 

This eliminates the need for both parties to be available for your request at the same time, making it ideal for 
applications that involve a human in the loop or are computationally expensive.

### What is a webhook?

Now that we know what an asynchronous flow is, what is a webhook?  Put simply, a webhook is a call to **your API**
that is the result of an event that happened in an external system.  Webhooks allow applications to communicate in real-time, but asynchronously.

Rolling with the example provided above, imagine you're tasked with integrating with a Help Desk company that provides 
agents that reviews documents your users submit.

1. You make an API call to the Help Desk company with the location of the document for them to review.
2. That API call immediately responds with an `agentId` representing the agent assigned to the case, a `documentId`, 
and a status of `PENDING_REVIEW` for the case.
3. When the agent reviews the document, it is ultimately marked as `ACCEPTED` or `DECLINED`.  At this time, the Help
Desk company will trigger a **webhook**, call your API, tell you the status, along with the `documentId`.

For completeness, I will call out that there are other ways to solve this problem, such as API Polling, but we will
avoid discussion of API Polling as webhooks are much more efficient.

Now that we have the terminology settled, let's run through an example below. 

This code is all available [here](https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks), so you can either follow along 
commit by commit (I'll link to the commits throughout), review the Pull Request 
[here](https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/pull/2), or start where I am starting at 
[this commit](https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/commit/92e74a9896d2c4e8254723d58e2c1e8f19530999).

## Prerequisites
In order to complete this section, you'll need a few things set up on your machine.

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Getting Situated

First off, we'll be working in TypeScript and using a framework called [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/) 
(don't be too worried about this, I'll hold your hand through anything not obvious.)

In our repository, we have a few different components set up via docker containers.  If you're not familiar with docker,
there's a great course on [docker in the boot.dev curriculum](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-docker), although it's not
required to have any knowledge of docker for this article.

If you'd like to take a look at our docker containers for this article, all of the components are defined in our
`docker-compose.yml` file [here](https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/blob/264749d1f1fbebc0682a61e9be2fd0033f6a1ed1/docker-compose.yml). 
Let's step through what each component is.

1. We have the `adonis_app` which we'll be using to call our external API.
2. We also have an `external_api`, which is somewhat self-explanatory.  This is the "Help Desk" API that we'll be
   calling that we can expect a webhook from at a later time.
3. In addition, there's a `postgres` container, as we'll need to store some data along the way.
4. There's also a `redis` container, but we won't be touching it, it's solely to facilitate our artificial webhook 
delay.

You can find the routes in `api/routes/start.ts`, which is where we'll be doing our implementation, and also in
`external/routes/start.ts` for the external API (these are already implemented for you).

Alright, what will we be building?  Sticking with the example above in our explanation of webhooks, we'll be calling a
POST endpoint to request a review for a document:

```
POST /document

Expected Request Body:
{
   documentUrl: string 
}

Expected Response Body:
{
   agentId: string,
   documentId: string
}
```

As you can see, while we want to know if the document has been `ACCEPTED` or `DECLINED`, in our help desk world, we need
to wait for a human to review it (the external API will artifically simulate a human review in this case by just waiting 2-5 seconds
before triggering our webhook - you can see this code in `external/routes/start.ts`)

With that said, here's the structure of the payload we can expect to receive in our own API, via webhook.

```
POST /document/update

Expected Request Body:
{
   agentId: string,
   documentId: string,
   documentStatus: 'ACCEPTED' | 'DECLINED'
}
```

Notice how I didn't note the Expected Response Body? That's because most webhooks don't really take much care
to what you respond - as long as you return a 200, 201, or 202 status code, they'll treat the call as a success and
move on.

## Implementation

Before we do anything in this section, you'll want to pull down the git repository found 
[here](https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/tree/main), run `git checkout 
292dff8f29a75eb7bb70e337ed32116bd9db68d4` and then `git checkout -b webhook-tutorial` to navigate to the proper starting
point. 

Once that's done,  run `docker compose up` from the root of the repository to bring up all of the containers needed for this 
next section.

### The Help Desk API Call

Let's start developing.  First, let's navigate to the `api` folder in our terminal and install Axios, a library that 
allows you to make HTTP calls with little effort. 

Our current project uses NPM, so let's add Axios as a dependency: 
`npm install axios`.  Resulting commit 
[here](https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/pull/2/commits/92e74a9896d2c4e8254723d58e2c1e8f19530999).

A quick rule of thumb here to note if you're new to Javascript or Typescript projects, if you see a `package-lock.json`,
you should use NPM, if you see a `yarn.lock` in the root instead, you should use Yarn.

Now with Axios installed, let's call the external API.  We're going to set things up so whenever you make a `GET`
call by visiting a page in the browser, the external API will be called (and subsequently triggering a webhook
afterwards.)

In our `api` folder, modify `routes/start.ts` to have the following logic for our base path (right around where you see 
`return { hello: 'world' }`).

```typescript
import axios from 'axios'

const OUR_API = 'http://adonis_app:3333'
const HELP_DESK_API = 'http://external_api:8080'

Route.get('/', async () => {
  await axios.post(
    `${HELP_DESK_API}/document`,
    { documentUrl: "https://boot.dev/community/" },
    { headers: { 'X-Callback-Url': `${OUR_API}/document/update` } }
  )
})
```

A couple of things to note in the commit 
[here](https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/pull/2/commits/2ef39c4afa7bf3138c990cf7673fad79f3299a4b).
1. In a real, live system, you'd probably want to define `OUR_API` and `EXTERNAL_API` in an environment file.  For the
simplicity of this tutorial, we've hard coded them.
2. The first parameter to `axios.post` is the endpoint you want to hit on the external API.  Rolling with our example
of a Help Desk API, we're requesting a document review of `https://boot.dev/community/`, which is the second parameter, 
the body of the request.
3. The third parameter defines "options" for the request.  In this case, we define an `X-Callback-Url` header, telling 
the Help Desk API where we want to receive our webhook when the data is ready for us.  The name of this tends to vary
depending on the platform you're integrating with - sometimes it's also defined as `X-Webhook-Url` or is defined
manually in an admin panel.

If you're interested how webhooks might vary depending on the platform you're integrating with, you can check out this 
[blog post](https://nickabbene.com/developer-experience-local-webhook-routing) which touches upon different types of 
webhooks and how to improve your developer experience around them when developing in local environments.

### The Webhook

With all of this confiugured, let's get to the meat and potatoes of it all, so we can see the webhook working.  We'll want
to do a few things.

1. Set up a database table, we'll want to store the `agentId` and `documentId` from the original response, so we know
what request the webhook belongs to later when we receive it.
2. Implement the **API Contract**, we'll need to actually receive the webhook
3. Test things, and make sure they're working as we expect.

#### Setting up the Database
Setting up the database table is relatively straight forward in AdonisJS, from your terminal, run 
`npm run ace make:model document_review` and then `npm run ace make:migration document_review`

This will create the model in AdonisJS, as well as the migration that sets up the database table.  You can see the
resulting commit 
[here](https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/commit/696a65ad9756f3c3c8e5884de003a027ae84c149).

Now, let's modify the structure of the model and the table to store the variables we'll need.

In the `DocumentReview.ts` model file:

```typescript
export default class DocumentReview extends BaseModel {
  @column({ isPrimary: true })
  public id: number

  @column()
  public documentUrl: string

  @column()
  public agentId: string

  @column()
  public documentId: string

  @column()
  public documentStatus: string

  @column.dateTime({ autoCreate: true })
  public createdAt: DateTime

  @column.dateTime({ autoCreate: true, autoUpdate: true })
  public updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

And in your migration file:

```typescript
public async up() {
    this.schema.createTable(this.tableName, (table) => {
      table.increments('id')

      table.string('document_url')
      table.string('agent_id')
      table.string('document_id')
      table.string('document_status')

      table.timestamp('created_at', { useTz: true })
      table.timestamp('updated_at', { useTz: true })
    })
  }
```

The commit for this can be found 
[here](https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/commit/7b23702af011d769e1d520c7efcd5774a75f165f).

Since we updated these files, we'll need to actually run the migration, telling AdonisJS to update our database to have
the columns that we need.  `npm run ace migration:run` runs all migrations files that have not been run against our
database yet, so let's go ahead and run it.  You should see something similar to the following:

```shell
> ftech@1.0.0 ace
> docker exec -it adonis_app node ace migration:run

❯ migrated database/migrations/1678285144402_document_reviews
```

Since we now have a table to store this data, we can go back and 
[update our API call](https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/commit/ac3007e401d28c7ddfced2ccd3c6c34197eaf5ad) 
to the Help Desk to store some of these variables.

```typescript
import DocumentReview from 'App/Models/DocumentReview'

... Other code here

Route.get('/', async () => {
   const documentToReview = 'https://boot.dev/community'
   const response = await axios.post(
           `${HELP_DESK_API}/document`,
           { documentUrl: documentToReview },
           { headers: { 'X-Callback-Url': `${OUR_API}/document/update` } }
   )

   await DocumentReview.create({
      documentUrl: documentToReview,
      agentId: response.data.agentId,
      documentId: response.data.documentId,
      documentStatus: 'PENDING_REVIEW',
   })
})
```

With this, we're ready to implement the API on our side.

#### Implementing the API Contract

As we noted above, we can expect the following payload back from the Help Desk API:

```
POST /document/update

Expected Request Body:
{
   agentId: string,
   documentId: string,
   documentStatus: 'ACCEPTED' | 'DECLINED'
}
```

Thus, we need to actually create the endpoint on our side. In `start/routes.ts`, 
[let's implement the logic](https://github.com/nickabb/async-flows-and-webhooks/commit/0caeffec9efb244d9c77bd00e82da23197dc3a5d) 
to receive the API call, as well as update the database with the result of the review based on the documentId.

```typescript
Route.post('/document/update', async ({ request }) => {
  const { agentId, documentId, documentStatus } = request.body()

  await DocumentReview.query()
    .where('documentId', documentId)
    .update({ agentId: agentId, documentStatus: documentStatus })
})
```

We're now ready to test!

#### Testing

Since we already ran `docker compose up` earlier, all of your containers should be running already.  In a web browser,
navigate to `http://localhost:3333/`.

If you don't get any response, you'll have to run `docker compose up`, and keep your containers up in the background.

A blank page should load. In order, the following happens.

1. The `/` route on `api/start/routes.ts` reaches out to the Help Desk API and stores the variables from the response.
2. There's a delay of approximately 2-5 seconds (if you're curious how this works, check out `external/start/routes.ts`
and `external/start/document-subscriber.ts`)
3. The external API calls back to your `/document/update` endpoint in `api/start/routes.ts`, updating the 
`documentStatus` field.

If you're not convinced, I've created a utility script under `api` that allows you to get into your database.

From your terminal, run `./local_db.sh`. You'll see a prompt for `psql`, the command line utility for Postgres.

```shell
psql (13.10 (Debian 13.10-1.pgdg110+1))
Type "help" for help.

adonis_app=>
```

`\dt` and enter should display the current tables.  You should see your `document_reviews` table.

Now, you can execute the following to see the table contents, feel free to run it in quick succession, to see the
values in the database both before and after the webhook hits your API.

```sql
SELECT * FROM document_reviews;
```

`\q` will exit the psql prompt.

We're done here!

### Going Further

Want to go further and learn more about webhooks?  Here are some features you would typically see implemented in a live
environment if you're interested in doing some more digging.

#### Retries

When a webhook call fails, you'll need to retry it at a later time.  Most **retry policies** have an [exponential 
  backoff](https://medium.com/gympass/handling-failed-webhooks-with-exponential-backoff-72d2e01017d7).  In our example, 
  this would be implemented in the `external` API.

#### Refactor logic into a controller

Our implementation currently has all the logic in the `routes.ts` file.  Consider refactoring the logic into a
  controller.  You can see an example of this with the `AuthorizationsController`.

#### Write some tests

No pull request is complete without tests! Feel free to write some.

#### Implement idempotency

[Learn about idempotency](https://nickabbene.com/idempotency-to-prevent-duplicates), and implement a middleware for idempotent requests.

#### Validate the payload of the request

What happens if we hit our webhook without the variables we expect? Can we handle it more gracefully? 

#### Optimize your database, [add indices](https://www.codecademy.com/article/sql-indexes)

Our webhook queries the database on the `documentId` field, which is not an index.  If we had many items in the database, the query would be slow.
